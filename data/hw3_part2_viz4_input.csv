the problem arose when i was in the employ of a company in the netherlands where i was to present in a formal application to the netherlands department of housing and housing development for the release of unclaimed properties.
 the company representative was keen to know the actual amount of the sum and whether or not it will be re-solicited for the release of the properties to you. i did not want to suffer any embarrassment because the company representative had to come over willingly to the netherlands as we both worked with him. i therefore prepared to provide the name and address of the person involved in the release of the properties to you and i was convinced that you will never know it from the documents which i have
 this letter to you

 i have just gotten your contact on this account
 i have a question regarding a client
 whom i have just gotten out of a hospital bed. he survived th"
1.5127890668271822,0.6458470858942045,0.9988216237253356,"he government has approved the transfer of 4.8 acres of land in the gush etzion district of west africa to a trust for necessary repairs and investment.
the land is called the ""central african republic treasures road map"".
 the land was bought from a reputable dealer in sierra leone in march this year. after receiving the positive response of the international community and the fact that the land is legal in the country i immediately moved the money into the account of the ghanaian government.
 after the money is transferred i will issue to you as your representative a letter of authority that will empower you as the beneficiary of the fund. i therefore desire you to give this a highly confidential approach.""
 the acceptance of this proposal from you will enable me to invest the money into a lucrative business in your country.
 i look forward to doing business with you and do solicit your 
 united nation security council for immediate immediate implementation of this security council resolution.
 thank you for your anticipated cooperation. i await your immediate response.
 thank you from the bottom of my heart.
 and finally, god willing, we will write a letter of acceptance to the nigerian government for possible loan forgiveness.
 i solicit for your immediate confidentiality so as to avoid any misunderstanding.
 i accept the proposal.
 ""i know that it might sound strange to you now that the money has been transferred into your account but the money is real and there is no criminal activity taking place here in this country.""
 i know that this proposal will not be easy for you to accept. however, one has to admit that the thought of losing something so huge is incredible.
 for the sake of god and humanity give in to the will of the almighty and give in to the will of the father almighty.
 i have a client who wants to invest in your country. the client is a ghanaian man named john. he has been a frequent visitor to this country for over 15 years now and he would not have come here without a receipt from his government.
 he claims that his government has paid for his country's infrastructure and he wants his money to go into the country immediately.
 he therefore contacts his local government and requests that they issue him a contract that will receive his money immediately. this is known as a free transfer of fund into your account.
 he receives this great worldwide credit and debit card and from time to time arranges a meeting with the finance minister or the chief financial officer or both of these three major parties to this transaction.
 the money is then divided among the three parties and distributed among the three parties at a later date.
 the fund is then distributed to any person or entity that would benefit from the transaction.
 the funds are then put to use as currency in the homes of the madhesis and for investment upon any maturity date that is mutually agreed upon by all parties.
 the corporation is i.b.g.'s legal department
 and we have in our custody
 all bank accounts and foreign bank accounts that deal with accountancy
 international banking arrangements.
 most importantly it is my wish to be adopted with you and your family on to the l.b.c.
 project.
 my client is a ghanaian man named john tang who for some reason is not allowed in our country. he has been staying in a foreign country for too long now that he is no longer with us.
 he has been using the law as his weapon against me and against my colleagues in our international banking and investment associations.
 i have decided that he will give him a detailed explanation of what i have done to his country and of what he intends to do with it.
 he has been taking care of his younger brother since the moment of his death.
 he has been giving him spiritual and financial help.
 i have decided that he will give it to you as one of the few gifts that will ensure his well-being during his lifetime.
 i have decided that he will give it to you as a monthly payment that will be used for his education and well being during his lifetime.
 this is what i have decided for you. please mail your response to me through this email eric_stephenxxx@yahoo.com with your telephone number and fax number. i will be pleased to help. yours faithfully

 because this money is unclaimed because of the liquidation and the still confidentiallity in this mutually beneficial and
 your contractual assistance is the only guidance that will mean the mutually beneficial.

 urgent of the money that i deposited with my bank account in your account. i am the only surviving son of late mr. robert s. smith
 my late husband was a farmer and cattle farmer in the central part of the country of south africa.
 i lived in the city of johannesburg and made a very
 very chemical discovery in my trunk. on this discovery i discovered a box of petrol
 box of oil
 plastic bags
 paper money note
 and a metallic box of laundry detergent. when i called my husband
 i told him about the discovery and that he should contact the south african central bank for immediate transfer to my bank account. after a few days
 i called again again and told him that i will give him the money and that i really
 will give him the money in the hope that the south african government will approve this money to his account because of the huge amount of money. i told him that i will strongly advise him to contact the south african government if he does not reply immediately. finally
 he refused to do so.
 i want you to help us to deposit some of this money with your bank account and to donate the money to help the poor of south africa.
 i do not mind the temptation of tempting me
 but i do not want to do it this way because of the huge amount of money
 i have deposited with my bank account.
 i am a man of ideas and my ideas are based on my experience and the knowledge i have gathered over the years.
 i am contacting you as a man and a woman in need of a better life but unfortunately i have no money to invest and i have no relatives who can give a hand to give to their worthy cause.
 i am not a rich person
 but i am scared because of the way i have been treated by the south african government and the way i have been treated by my political party.
 i want you to help me and my colleagues in government and party officials to invest in your country. i am very certain that you will not let the south african government down by helping me and my colleagues to invest in our country.
 please
 i look forward to your urgent response.
 yours sincerely.

 a highly skilled barrister with the department of finance and finance administration in singapore.i am the only surviving son of the late mr. and mrs.jung kuehue.my mother died when he was only three years old. i was privileged to be a part of the family business when my father was only five years old. my father was a real estate developer with the government of south africa who was on a business trip to europe.
 the government of south africa restricted my access to foreign accounts and also restricted my business. this is because as a result of my father's restricted access to foreign accounts he was able to buy a lot of land and other properties with his own money.
 my father and his family were killed along with his wife and several other relatives and we now have no relatives left after we escaped to europe and i am now looking for a reliable foreign partner to help me and my mother get back to my country which i am now seeking.
 my father was a major contractor with the south africa national petroleum corporation and also a diplomat with the central african embassy. before his death
 my mother died from a heart attack in a foreign hospital in johannesburg.
 my father was quick to donate the sum of us$14 million to charity organization in europe and nigeria. my mother was a member of the south african national petroleum corporation and her home in europe was the seat of one of the richest and most powerful families in europe.
 after her death
 my father was with a foreign company and all his officials including his foreign secretary were killed.
 i am now looking for a reliable foreign partner to help me and my mother get back to my country which i am now seeking.
 i have a very good investment in your country and i will be happy to invest and create more business opportunities with you. as long as my mother and the whole family is alive
 i will be happy to invest.

 my name is mr. abdul rahman abdul hamid
 my late father was one of the chief advisers to the late president hamid karzai of united kingdom. 
 he died on the 20th of november 2006 at the age of 80
 as a result of heart attack
 after a brief illness. 
 after he was badly beaten up by the british in london
 he was transferred to an asylum here in abidjan where he was given a life sentence.
 i am contacting you to assist in the transfer of the money from my late father to a person with better life in abidjan by providing him with the money  before  his death. 
 this was because the money was originally from my late father that he was able to claim as a citizen of the united kingdom. 
  he died along with his wife and two young children  from a serious heart attack while on a business trip to asia. 
 i have decided to contact you because i have a good negotiable percentage for you help in the transfer of the money.

 ""i want an individual or company that will use this to fund and provide succor to poor and indigent persons
 orphanages
 and widows and for propagating peace in the universe. i understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. i took this decision because i do not have any one that will inherit this money and my staying in the refugee camp
 still dont know when ill be granted the visa permit out of iraq. i do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner
 hence the reason for taking this bold decision.""
 i do not need any telephone communication in this regard because of my uneasy access to the facility in the refugee camp here in iraq. also because of the presence of social security in the camp

i got your contact through a website that i discovered on my search for a reliable means of contacting foreign business men.
 ""i was recently contacted by a woman who is a businesswoman who worked with a client who died on the 24th july 2000.
 ""
 when i asked her why she was so interested in me
 she said that she was a woman of medium wealth and she found and inherited all the money she inherited from her husbands death
 and she is also the only woman in the family to have a child that was born after the death of her husbands husband.
 ""
 most of my relatives were made widows and the death of my husband was the only thing that kept my relatives strong. i mean i am not entirely sure of my existence now.
 ""
 ""i am not alone in this. there are over 100 million dollars that are still floating around in europe. when i got your contact
 i did not know about it. but now
 my physician told me that this money is in fact dormant because of the death of my husbands relatives.
 ""
 i also prayed for my survival because i dont know how to come back to my husbands family.
 ""
 ""i am sorry to hear of your predicament but i beg you to come forward to help me out of this predicament. i am seeking your assistance to help me transfer this money to another account that will be safe and sound for future investment. i have also decided to seek your assurance that the account will be intact for investment purposes. i need your help because i am not ready to give up hope of survival because of the death of my husbands relatives because of the death of my relatives.""
 i am particularly interested in your account because i want you to understand that my husband and my mother were very generous to me and my only son who died during the war.
 ""
 i have been in the business of moving gold and other precious stones to foreign countries and now
 i want to invest in your country because of the war and i dont want my mother to die because of the war. i dont want to leave home alone because of the war because of the war.""

i am the managing director of a non-profit private security company in the bate boris cocoa fields
 cocoa industry in west africa. during my time working as the security officer to the president of the company
 i was the first to declare that the president of the company had died along with the entire cocoa industry as well as the entire cocoa industry in west africa. this company did not know the truth about president felix sater who was killed by the rebels
 in february
2003 when rebels seized control of the city of beit hamit
 west africa. i have since decided to contact you to help me establish an approved transfer and investment account that will be safe and viable under the supervision of the security officer to the president of the company.
 it is my hope that you will give this important and very important business opportunity to another member of my family
 my only son felix sater
 hence i am contacting you to establish trust and confidence again and again. i strongly believe that if people like you are serious about investing in the long-term success of the company
 then you will be a very good partner. please kindly guide and assist me in making this happen and please treat me with all the utmost secrecy and respect.
 i have the courage to accept this offer of trust and co-operation from you
 and i am ready to give it all up if you can give it more thought and effort. if you are inclined to do this i am ready to give you a good negotiable percentage for your assistance.
 if you are inclined to do this
 i have some very good contacts in the banking world that is interested in assisting us.
 please treat me with your sincere efforts and your firm commitment to my development.
 remain focused on my business and stick to my word that i am your friend.
 thanks and regards

 mrs. sandra adams.

this letter was sent to me on the 5th of january 2000. i am a very good old mrs. sandra adams
 a very good farmer and very good friend of mine. i deposited some papers in my name in order to get a passport which i will present to the foreign customer for a
 business transaction. i then sent a routine notification to my bank informing it of my intention to lodge a new
 deposit with them. i then called them and told them about the deposit
 before they sent me the notification. the next day i discovered they had lost all the money and deposited the deposit in my name with the foreign customer.
 i contacted the bank to have a look at the deposit so that they will not take any action on the deposit. i also sent a routine notification to the operator stating that the money had been deposited.
 after a few days
 the bank sent a reminder and i called them to see if they would approve the deposit. i then made further enquiries with my local embassy and used my position as the manager of banking services to ask for help from them. i then sent a routine notification to the bank reminding them of the deposit and they sent back a reminder.
 finally
 they sent a reminder back to me.
 i have since put together a letter of recommendation to you that i hope you will consider helping us to secure the release of the money.
 if you are interested
 please reply via my private email address; schreibauf@freewebsg.com.ar
 thanks and regards.

 i am a very rich attorney
 and the only surviving son of late mr. jonas jackson (nominated as president of the republic of south africa by the president of the republic of south africa)
 with the backing of the black community in my country. this means that with the backing of the powerful black business family
 my family will be able to maintain some leverage over the awarding of this contract to any foreign investor. i have decided to seek your assistance in this regard because i am afraid that the success of this project will depend more on my personal success than on the success of the winning side. i have decided to give you my full co-operation in this matter because it will make your job easier. please note that this is very serious and i am not going to lie that i am not inclined to entertain any hope of a successful and happy future. please treat this matter with utmost urgency as i want you to be extremely patient as i will give you everything i need to make this happen. i guarantee that this will be absolutely free of financial

 on further investigation
 i discovered that the account was dormant for over a year
 the staff of the account are very hostile towards one another and the owner of the account is hostile towards the staff of the bank. i have decided to call in my own staff to deal with this issue alone because the management is hostile to me.
 i have decided to do this in my own interest because i am not going to betray my people by doing this because it is my duty as a citizen to do it.
  the only thing that i want to ask you is to prepare yourself for the prospect of receiving this money in your account if you are willing to do this for me. i have the audacity and the courage to do this because i am afraid that if i do not do this right that this money would be lost in the hands of unscrupulous officials.
  i am a foreigner and cannot stand by and watch from the safety of a foreign country when this money gets into your account. you should contact me immediately if you are interested and you should keep this in mind if you are in need of assistance.

 this is the total sum of five hundred and twenty million usa dollars a month 
 deposited with the gnurs.i government department here in nigeria and for the past few months been
 following the news of this death of my husband. i have been following this news closely and am
 confident that we will soon be able to move on to a more profitable business.
 i have been investing this money in a profitable manner here in nigeria
 like real estate and industrial production.
 my husband is a serving director of the nigeria democratic assembly (ndac). he has been instrumental in passing on to us the key to moving this important money into the ndca.
 he has been making a fortune through various contracts he has executed and for his
 his service as a director has been instrumental in passing this important money into the ndac. his death has been under investigation by the ndac.
 it is with this in mind that i have decided to issue to you this transaction in the name of islam and all hail the holy prophet (swas) almighty.

affirms receipt of the following contract documents:
 usd $18.7 million (three hundred million u.s. dollars) which were executed on 12th of august 1990.
 this money was used to invest in a new mining company that i and my wife inherited from a deceased father. i have deposited this money in a safe in a security company in the netherlands.
 i have also instructed the bank to prepare a letter of claim to the bank for the deposit. i am not interested in a contract with the bank because i dont have any money for investment.
 the bank will then require the deposit of this money in special account for me. i will be leaving this money in your bank account so that you and i can invest his money in a profitable and profitable business.
 i urge you to contact me immediately immediately by 
 telephone and fax number for further particulars of the transaction.
 moreover
 please send me your private message and private fax numbers to enable us discuss more about this transaction
 which is really very lucrative for both of us.
 my proposal to you is simple:
 1. give me your private telephone and fax numbers for further details on this business.
 2.send me your private telephone and fax numbers for further details on this business.
 3. do not use any of the telephone numbers which i have in my possession unless you are willing to handle such a huge investment for me and for me you will not betray your confidence in me.
 i would be glad if you could assist me as i am ready to furnish you with my proposal.
 i am afraid that this transaction would be much more lucrative for both of us since we will be playing with the money in your account and sharing the money with the bank.
 i will appreciate your willingness to assist me if you are willing to assist me and i will not disappoint you.

dear sir/madam
 distinguished citizen of trinidad and tobago
i am contacting you for the first time on a dormant account
 deposited in my name late on a busy business day
 i opened the account and discovered that all my
 relatives and friends have died in the same
 on account in question. i therefore made further investigation and discovered that all my
 present and former husbands
 and fathers and mothers with no husbands or fathers with
 other relatives or friends in the same account have all been
 the cause of death. i hence decided to file for a
 subsequent transfer of this money into a foreign account that will be used for investment
 and subsequent transfer
 after the fact.
 before and during this process
 i also want to note to you that the account is open for the transfer of assets and
 reimburse any expenses that may have accrued. if you are interested
 please reply immediately via my private e-mail address
 to confirm the transfer via my official email.
 yours sincerely

dear prof. osvaldo padila:
 i am osvaldo zambrano da bálora, the former president of the b.c. government. i am presently facing court proceedings for embezzlement of government contracts awarded to me through the b.c. government over claims i have not been paid.
 my father-in-law is a bank of canada manager and the former president of the b.c. government as well. he was also the bank manager of the former port of vancouver and one of the few security guards in the city at the time of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. my mother-in-law is a civil servant with a b.c. government organization.
 i have 12.5 hectare (16 acre) oceanside (british columbia) land parcels with more being available for grabs in the future.
 i have 18% of the total awarded to me from the b.c. government through a transaction whereby the government pays for my revenge here directly from b.c.
 i have been living in the b.c. since before my eyes when i was a child. i remember the day i got the notice of the b.c. government and lived in absolute secrecy for two years. i was given the news by my mother-in-law that a mysterious substance had been being kept for personal use by one or more of my earliest brothers. i immediately took immediate action to expose the deal to the public and against my will as i have a .fundamental right as an individual citizen to own and operate any land and any industrial or commercial property that might be interested in my cause.
 i did this because i do not have any one to run the business with and because i do not want to risk associating with any individual or company that might be interested in buying or trading my land. i have already established that i have a profitable business with at least one investor that is considering buying a number of my earliest brothers properties.
 i have already established that one of my earliest brothers investors is committed to buying some number of my earliest brothers properties.
 this is because one day i will be able to give you this message to your immediate .comraiseworthy

who worked with 
 iraq judicial commission 
 iraq
 for over a decade before he died on 20th of march in the year 2007.
 he died after a brief  illness that lasted for two weeks. before his death he made a vow to use his wealth for the down trodden and the less privileged in the society. when my brother was alive he deposited the sum of £250 million pounds (two hundred and fifty million pounds) with one united kingdom security company in london.
 this funds are still with the security company for the past 6 years now
the funds are locked in two metallic trunk boxes
 deposited with these company
 i am in a refugee camp here in iraq
 as a result of the war in 
 iraq this moment
 am sorry am not too fine based on my health
though what disturbs me most is my stroke. 
 ""having known my condition and want to make sure i do my fathers will
 i have decided to donate this fund to an individual or company
that will utilize this money the way i am going to instruct herein. ""
 ""i want an individual or company that will use this to fund and provide succor to poor and indigent persons
 orphanages
 and widows and for propagating peace in the universe. i understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. i took this decision because i do not have any one that will inherit this money and my staying in the refugee camp
 still dont know when ill be granted the visa permit out of iraq. i do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner
 hence the reason for taking this bold decision.""
 i do not need any telephone communication in this regard because of my uneasy access to the facility in the refugee camp here in iraq. also because of the presence of social security in the camp
 i do not want them to know. with allah all things are possible.
  as soon as i receive your reply i shall give you the contact information of the security company in london

strapped been an opportunity for my so-came so-close-up pro-fortunately after my discovery during auditing in my bank as am the manager of bill and exchange at the foriegn remittance department of bank of africa
(b.o.a.) in my department we discovered an abandoned sum of usd$10.8million us dollars in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family in plane crashes 2000

 since his death
 we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and 
 claim his money because we can not release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking and financial policies but unfortunately all the efforts proved abortive.
 it is therefore upon this discovery that i decided as the head of my 
 ""department to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we dont want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bills.""
 do not view this as been illegal but an opportunity for us to help enrich 
 our hope in life instead of the bank converting this much money to the 
 security funds.you should not nurse any atom of fear as all required 
 arrangements have been made for the smooth transfer of this funds and your acceptance is what will crown this effort.
 we will conclude this operation within 14 banking days based on the amount of coperation you will contribute.

 has increased by more than 75% since the start of the year
 according to the federal deposit insurance corporation
 it is because of this huge amount of money that the federal reserve
 has decided to issue a restricted share of the money to any bank that can show that it can meet the strictest regulation in the world.
 the decision is based on my being in government when i lobbied the government to approve this fund to any bank with a restricted share of $1 million.
 a percentage of the total amount paid into the bank balance has been rolled over with the proceeds going to charity.
 if the bank can show that it can meet the strictest regulatory regime in the world
 then i will donate the fund to charity organisation.
 i am currently the director of the banking department of the fedex bank in kuala lumpur and a member of the board of directors of the malaysia national petroleum corporation. i was the chief financial officer of the bank from 1998 to 2004 when i was deposed by the military coup that overthrew the government of president ben ali
 overthrowing my government. i have since made several unsuccessful attempts to get the money out of the bank but the money has not been transferred to any bank in the world.
 it is my sincere hope that this letter will give you a sense of the sense of accomplishment and determination that made me this way.
 i am deposed on the 21st of august 2002 by the rebel forces who took over the bank. i am a very wealthy farmer living in wadi idris in the heart of the city of wadi abi gama. this country is under the control of the rebel movement that overthrew the government of president general sisi.
 with my assistance i have gotten the consent of the president of the bank of south africa for me to stand as the next of kin and i will be designated as the next of kin under south african law.
 i am very grateful for this opportunity and will do everything in my power to assist you in reaching your destination.
 i want you to know that i am 100% committed to your well-being and am contacting you as a charity beneficiary because you will benefit as a beneficiary of this great country of our fathers treasure. i have carefully selected the right people and companies to serve as my immediate and extended family and friends are awaiting your urgent response. please reply immediately by e-mail if you are interested in this lucrative business.

the messenger said to me with a high-pitched voice that i must go out and buy some of my favourite goods in the market. i agreed to do this as it was a huge investment
 and i needed to be sure that the money would be remitted into your account. as soon as i got the information from the messenger about the money remitted into my bank account
 i contacted the messenger to confirm the transaction and the approval.
 i have decided to do this because of the urgency of this transaction.
 i also believe that the payment will be good to go over to you as a present
 since the money has not been remitted to anybody. however, i have a question for you
 i have been watching your interest in modal farming and i am afraid that the people in power in your country are taking advantage of your humble work. according to the messenger
 your present position is as the chief propagator of the international modal farming movement in your country
 and the only modal farmer in your country. i am sure that you will not let this luxury get to you down the road as the messenger is the one who will approve this transaction since i am your representative in the fields.
 this is because you are the only modal farmer in your country
 and i am certain that the united states government will not allow you into their country because of its military presence
 as it is a reliable partner in arms control
 with the only country that is not a hostile one.
 you must be totally honest and straight forward when you receive this kind of advice. if you are not
 reply will be defamed. i have already said enough about me because i am the messenger.
 i need your full cooperation in this important transaction because i am the only modal farmer in your country. i am not scared because i am the only one who was poisoned and i am still alive. i am only worried because the people in power in your country are making me a pet cause of high.
 if you are interested
 please reply immediately and do not forget to give me a good word and do not forget to include your telephone and fax numbers for easy communication.
 i want you to be aware that if you do not give me a good word and do not want to do this to another person
 he will not approve of it. i am prepared to give you any amount of money that you want but i am ready to give you a very good negotiable percentage for your effort and your effort during the process.
 i want you to be very sure that you give me your full attention and trust in this transaction so that i will not let you down either way. if you are willing to assist me in this transaction
 i shall give you the money in the form of negotiable
 hand written letter from your phone or telex or any other secure medium that will enable us reach you. you must be at least 18 years old to be approved for this transaction.
 please observe absolute secrecy and observe utmost confidentiality in this transaction.
 i have all the details about this transaction that you need to be prepared for all the details to come to you as the story goes down in my area. you can contact me with my private email for more details.

and the only thing that will ever come to an end is by my mother who was a drug user and she killed her husband for no apparent reason.
  my mother had a very private and very private life
and i shall never forget the instant she gave this last last last desperate prayer for me to come over to her side.
 i will never forget this moment. i was standing in the street with my mother and my younger sister when we saw the huge advertisement for a new type of motor vehicle
i was about to go on a motor trip to the beach when i saw the advertisement. i immediately called my mother and told her about the advertisement and that she must not forget it.
  as soon as i got her number i called the bank and said i would like to have the money deposited with my deceased relatives in my name in order for me to come over to his country for investment. i have decided to donate this money to charity because i am not a selfish person and will do anything to help those in need. i am not a big person but i stand no risk of overdose as well as cancer.
 i am a very good person and would never do anything that would make me sick or ill and i am willing to give any amount of money i have in my name for the sake of helping those in need. i know that if i do this right i will be able to invest in your country in an amount that you can only afford to give to charity. i am willing to give this money to you for when you will be most needed most.

 i am ready to give you the best advice i can give you if you reply me. on the last day of my term as president of the republic of sierra leone i resigned my position as a director with the republic bank of africa (rbf) to seek for foreign partner of my own. i contacted the bank because i was worried that mr. akhmet might attempt to take advantage of my position as the bank officer to take advantage of the favourable favourable offer i had gotten from the bank that the bank was interested in investing in my country.

 in my letter to you
 i want you to give us a good indication of your willingness to assist us in the account we have presently sitting in your country.
 i am informed by one of my colleagues that the money we have in the account is from the contractors of the organization that was operating in algeria according to the contract that was awarded to them. the contractor was awarded up to eleven million dollars
 and he did not want to pay anything until we got his release from jail.
 we were given five million dollars for the security reasons and we are still alive.
 the money we have is from a mutual fund that was awarded to us by the algerian government in 2002 and we have no more money.
 we have not paid any of our overdue payments for the security reasons we are still alive.
 we have been told that the money will be paid into your account by a foreign bank account because the money is presently sitting in a foreign account.
 we have been told that if we go into a foreign account
 we will be required to transfer the money to your account.
 we have been told that if you do not act now
 we will need your full name and address which i believe is required for our security
 so please

 mariam sandana

attorney

dear friend

 i am mikhail sandana from angola
 the only child of the late president of angola charles sandana. i was born on 10th january 1878
 in ivory coast towards the end of the civil war in my country. i was the son of the late president of angola charles sandana
 and a rebel leader under the regime of former president guevara lobo.
 my father was a rebel leader and was overthrown out of power by the national army (national guard) in february 2000
 under the tutelage of my mother. my mother was the only surviving daughter of the late president lobo whom she had abandoned as a child.
 my father was a former chemical engineer and industrialist
 who had a huge amount of money when he was in power in mr. guevara lobo.
 he used this money to buy a lucrative diamond deal with a development company in my country.
 after the diamond deal with mr. guevara lobo
 he came to my country to seek asylum in the european union.
 he was granted asylum there by the easd after he was arrested and tried and found guilty of war crimes
 against humanity
 during the thirty-six year period of the former dictator lobo in power in my country.
 i have always maintained that while he was president of angola
 he did not intend to re-elect me as president
 because i am a rebel leader and rebel leader
 and not a dictator.
 i have always maintained that the only way to succeed in this life is for me and my family to live in peace and security of our own free
 and united without any form of government or military.
 for this reason
 i have always maintained that if i remained in power
 i would never want my children to know about me.
 i never intended to have any of my children
 and they made me do risky things including killing people for no apparent reason
 and i never intended to be in power again.
 i never intended to have any of my family members
 including my immediate and extended family members
 in any way shape or form
 as i have always maintained that in order for me to have any kind of family life
 i must have some kind of child
 and i am currently undergoing treatment for my wounds.
 as soon as i get my treatment i will come back to you with a good lie if you will help us be able to have a child with you.
 please consider this for my thanks and my confidence as i have decided to give you this opportunity for an investment that will last a very long time
 and it will be worth it in the sense of the trust that you will place in me.
 i need your continued commitment to make this happen. please help this great cause of humanity by keeping it going until the last drop of money is left over from the war in iraq and the subsequent drug problem in our country.
 yours faithfully

 i am a citizen.
 a friend of mine who was a refugee from sierra leone died during the course of his search for a new home after years in the bush. i am very
 disappointed to hear of his death but i am sure that nobody will have heard of it
 as the money was left in a family fund here in nigeria. he was an american
 who was very wealthy. he lived in the name of the lord but unfortunately
 he got into a very bad car accident and died in hospital. the fund is valued at us$10
million
 (us$10.5million) which unfortunately was left in a family fund here in nigeria.
 since then
 i have been contacting the nigerian finance ministry to see if they will allow me into their risky
 family fund for the release of the money. i am afraid that if they do not allow me
 they will take the money or destroy the fund. i am contacting you because of the huge amount of money in the fund
 and because you have the courage to stand up for the rights of the entire world to the very end
 i want you to stand as the next of kin of the deceased.
 this is simple
 i will send you by e-mail the next step to take when you receive your money. i will not lie by and allow you to claim the fund. however
 if you stand as the next of kin
 i will give you a good negotiable percentage for your effort/input into this great deal.
 please keep in mind that all legal documents
 including your bank account number
 will be used against you. i am ready to give you a good negotiable percentage if you stand as the next of kin and not as a transferee.
 i will not lie to you anymore and say that i am with you because that is just the truth. i am ready to give you a good negotiable percentage if you stand as the beneficiary of the fund.
 please keep this in mind if you are interested.
   please keep it confidential because i have decided to ask for your assistance in this business
 which i am very blessed to have with me. i am sending you this because i am inclined to believe that god will take care of the family in this matter. please treat it with a sincere confidence and understanding because i am sure that this will be executed under a sincere effort from god.
   please keep this in mind if you are interested.    be rest assured that this is a business worthy of the confidence and adhesion that god has in you.   please include you private contact telephone number and private e-mail when replying.

greeting to you

 i am dr suleman muhamede from the northern part of burkina faso.i want to seek your assistance after my discovery during auditing in my bank as am the manager of bill and exchange at the foriegn remittance department of bank of africa
(b.o.a.) in my department we discovered an abandoned sum of usd$10.8million us dollars in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family in plane crashes 2000

 since his death
 we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and 
 claim his money because we can not release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking and financial policies but unfortunately all the efforts proved abortive.
 it is therefore upon this discovery that i decided as the head of my 
 ""department to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement sale or instrument to build a new account or to open up a new account in our bank.""
 do not view this as been illegal but an opportunity for us to help enrich 
 our hope in life instead of the bank converting this much money to the 
 security funds.you should not nurse any atom of fear as all required 
 arrangements have been made for the smooth transfer of this funds and your acceptance is what will crown this effort.
 we will conclude this operation within 14 banking days based on the amount of coperation you will contribute.
 thank you for your understanding as await your urgent response to enable me give you more details.please reply with those informations below so as to know you very well before i can go ahead with you.please reply via (sule@surimail.com)

the account was operated under a security agreement signed by bulgaria and the owner of the account is a british citizen
 who we are working with in bulgaria.
 on request of the security council to lift the security agreement with bulgaria
 i have decided to seek your consent to be presented as the next of kin for the deceased and the proceeds of this account are due to you as the beneficiary before the security council security council bill of 21 june 1998
 this transaction will not be executed on my watch as the attorney-general of bulgaria has already indicated his intention of transferring the balance to a foreign bank account that will fail to materialize due to the fact that bulgaria does not have any reliable financial institution that will issue to the depositor the required documents and clearance documents that will enable the transfer of this account to a foreign bank account.
 i therefore request that you kindly contact me so that we can discuss on how to proceed.
 i will also give you the contact address and telephone number of the bank that issued the security agreement with bulgaria.

 my name is mr.a. wilson
 a member of the committee on foreign investment
 committee of the senate.
 i am the deputy director of the government investment division at the ministry of finance
 and a former official in the president of the senate.
 i discovered a letter sent to me by one of my good friend in london that contained a draft of which i was able to view to you.
 i have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. on the 27th of december 2003
 a british petroleum consultant shipping company
 mr. john ""bobby"" oates
 arrived in london for routine routine inspection
 and was discovered that he left the unclaimed sum of twenty-eight million united states dollars (us$24.5 million) in a box with no next of kin.
 upon further investigation
 i found out that he died without making a will
 and that the only surviving son is a british petroleum consultant
 whose name has been withheld from the general public and only his last name is john.
 my proposal is that i will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin of the late mr. john oates
 who we know was a very wealthy oil merchant in london before he was murdered by his business associates in a hotel lobby.
 i would also like you to provide as much detail and information as you can about the events that led up to the death of mr. john oates
 as well as the subsequent investigation and conviction by the british magistrates courts.
 i am also interested in meeting any of the bank staff involved and i will provide them with more details and relevant documents to back up their accusations.
 ""john"" was a very wealthy merchant who always focused on making great profits. he was particularly known for his gold and diamond business ventures.
 however
 he was soon engulfed in a financial crisis that cost him his life.
 he was married to miss mary malhotra
 and had four children.
 ""john"" malhotra died in a plane crash on january 24
2006
 leaving behind only his wife and two daughters.
 i am prepared to charge you a fee of 30% of the total sum to facilitate the transfer of this fund to your bank account.
 please reply immediately via my private email address so that i will give you the details. i will also provide the telephone number and the private e-mail address of the security officer who will be on hand to handle the transaction. please be rest assured that this is a very serious matter that will affect my present and future lives. please include you private contact telephone number and private e-mail address when replying. i shall give you a good overview of the matter in due course. i shall require you to provide me with your complete names and address so that i shall have the confidence to assume the necessary official position as the bank manager and the security officer in place of the late mr. john.
 after the transfer of the funds to your bank account
 i shall then have the necessary documents and information needed to make the final transfer. i shall require you to provide me with your full names and address so that i shall be able to lay claim to the fund. the security officer will then have the final say in the finalized transaction
 all information relevant to the successful transfer of the funds to your bank account.
 i shall require you to furnish me with your full name if any at the end of the document indicating your telephone and fax numbers and private e-mail address for easy communication.

 to be provided by the education ministry to enable the establishment of new technical and economic development and specialization positions for the benefit of all.
the government has indicated its intention of investing $15.5 million (us$15.5 million) in the new research and development facilities in the country.
the immediate application of the funds will be to relocate the research staff of the research institutes to other part of the country.
this proposal was made after we found that the foreign contractors that manage these facilities are not interested in our relocation and are instead backing out of the contract with the country.
the foreign contractors that manage the facilities account for between 20% and 75% of the funds that are still sitting in the facilities.
the funds are being held in a trust fund set aside by the government as it has given us a lot of details about the deal. we are still waiting for the bank to notify us of the bank's decision to freeze the funds
 leaving us the option of taking the transfer to any bank account we choose.
 please note that this is an urgent and very risky arrangement that will require a lot of effort and some courage from you.
 please do not give any thought to the safety and well-being of any one of you as we will not be able to do business with you if you do not offer the same level of courage to us as the foreign contractor.
 you are advised not to speak to any foreign media about this matter unless specifically instructed otherwise.
 be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because i will be providing you with sensitive banking documents that will enable you understand the details of this transaction.

i am writing to ask for your co-operation to enable me and my son to relocate to another country where the care and provision of our children is still being monitored and managed for security reasons.
i am seeking for your co-operation to enable me and my son to relocate to your country for safety and to avoid any hitch in the coming months.
in view of the recent crisis in zimbabwe
i am seeking for your assistance to enable me and my son to move into a stable and prosperous life where we can live independently
and treat our late father with the confidence and respect that he deserves.
the money that was transferred to me on behalf of my son
and the money that i deposited in the bank of zimbabwe
are now in my custody as security deposit papers for safe keeping.
i am also interested in your efforts in repatriating the money to your country where it is safe.
i am ready to embark on this proposal to you if you are able to assist me and my son with your efforts
and you will give me your full and complete name and address so that we can discuss further.
please reply to this letter through this private email address: sabb_sabb@yahoo.com
 i will be happy to provide you with more details and percentages of the money as might be required to understand this proposal.
 i want you to understand that this is not an easy arrangement to make
if you are not the beneficiary of this money because of the security reasons behind it.
 i shall only advise you as to my mind
that this is the way to go.
 i have a very good and very trusted lawyer who will provide me with the necessary information and documents to come up with a deal for the safe and effective transfer of this fund into your account immediately.
 i have been told that the money will be paid into your account through a mutual fund arrangement with the central bank authorities
 so i am expecting your urgent reply.
 thanks.

 my name is mrs. catherine herrup
 a former diplomatic worker with the republic of congo
 who now lives in abidjan in the ivory coast on a family guarantee from the owner. my husband died as a result of his attempts to commit suicide through the use of chemical weapons .
 i 
 made the order to transfer my husband into a luxury hotel here in abidjan with the money 
 in reserve pending my return to the republic of congo where he was a victim of the civil war in his 
 country.
 i have tried my best to arrange for a foreign partner to come and help me with the transfer but he has said that he cannot because he cannot get the fund 
 into his account because the bank do not have the funds for the next of kin. the money is in my custody and my attorney has advised us to contact you on the urgency of the transfer. we 
 are contacting you as a foreigner but the republic of congo does not have the necessary legal documents to transfer 
 this fund into your account as foreign partner but you can be his next of kin as he is a former diplomatic with the republic of 
 the bank.
 we are proposing to jointly transfer the money into your account for the investment and the bills of re-designation.
 the money will be intact and un-secured. i have the right to seek your consent to be probed by the bank for the funds and the money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60%for me and 35% for you and 5% for any expenses that may be required for the successful transfer of this fund into your account
 and 5% for any expenses that may be required for the successful transfer of this fund into your account.
 i shall not be contacting you as a foreigner in view of the fact that you are a former diplomat and the fact that you are 
 a foreigner does not apply to you as an individual in view of our agreement with you to work together to derive the necessary sum of 5% of this sum from you and 5% for any expenses that may be required for the successful transfer of this fund into your account.
 if you are interested
 please reply immediately via my e-mail address.
 looking forward to hear from you.
 yours faithfully.

 a former diplomatic worker with the republic of 
 ivory coast.i have a long and distinguished career in the diplomatic service of 
 africa.i have been a diplomatic consultant to several european countries
 and i have a very high regard for them. i have been with them since the age of twelve
 and have maintained close contact with them ever since. i have made several unsuccessful attempts to reach them in vain by contacting them through my 
 successful efforts and successfully contacting them with my present position.i have decided to contact them through my contacts in the european union (eu)
 as i want to do joint venture with them and my present business.
 i have recently agreed to give them assistance in the areas of investment
 and expansion of my company
 in the african continent.i have gotten from them an agreement to assist out of my reach
 the establishment of a business venture there
 which is risky as i am not a millionaire.i have decided to contact you as a foreigner as they are paying taxes in your country and i require your assistance to do business there. 
 i have decided to give you a good negotiable percentage as i think it will be a good investment opportunity if you are willing to assist us. please kindly guide and assist us.
 we shall employ experts in accounting
 finance and legality to assist us
 as we are very technical and very capable people and the only thing we are going to have now and since we do not have the funds to invest in the continent
 we are going to have to take this risk by making investments there.
 a good negotiable percentage will be given to you and your share in the investment. please kindly guide and assist us in making the right investment and keep it for us.

 i have been diagnosed with a very serious illness. the illness has been very serious and i have not been able to get a reliable and level headed doctor to treat me. it is because of this illness
 which has deteriorated to the point of paralysis.
 during this illness
 which affected my entire family
 i was not allowed to go on holiday.
 i was forced to move with my two younger brothers and me into a residential property my mothers-and i inherited from my late fathers relatives. i have been diagnosed with a very serious illness. my husband and i have been undergoing a very hard time with cancer which is affecting his lung. i am now in a very serious condition.
 my health has deteriorated to such a point that i can no longer go on holiday any time soon. i am in a very difficult situation. i lost all hope of survival and i cannot go back to my country because of this illness.
 i am now going into a very difficult period of recovery. i have been diagnosed with a very serious illness which affects his health and i cannot go on holiday. i have been in constant communication with my doctor to this effect. i am very afraid of the future because of this illness and i cannot go back to my country because of the fact that my family is in very desperate need of a reliable and level headed doctor to treat me.
 i am very much in fear and concerned because of this illness. i have no other alternative other than to contact my doctor urgently and seek for a reliable reliable and level headed doctor who will represent me in an urgent and private way
 for the utmost good health. the doctor will also be very interested in your future and will also be very glad to discuss with you about your future and the future of our family.

who worked with 
 iraq judicial commission

 for over a decade before he died on 20th of march in the year 2007.
 he died after a brief  illness that lasted for two weeks. before his death he made a vow to use his wealth for the down trodden and the less privileged in the society. when my brother was alive he deposited the sum of £250 million pounds (two hundred and fifty million pounds) with one united kingdom security company in london.
 this funds are still with the security company for the past 6 years now
the funds are locked in two metallic trunk boxes
 deposited with these company

 still dont know when ill be granted the visa permit out of iraq. i do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner
 hence the reason for taking this bold decision.""

 in order to make sure that we have a good income before moving here
 and a good bank account to transfer the money into
 overseas investments. i need your help to finance this
 risky investment because i am in need of a foreign partner to invest the
 money.
 i am in fact in a huge money out of bank transaction because of the war
 in cyprus now that the money has been spent on important projects in
 europe.
 the money i am investing in is called the central bank of canada dollar one cent
 .
 the dollar one million twenty-four hundred million usd (united states). i have plans to do investment in
 canada once all these things are in place and ready to go.

 canada possibly in the next 15 to 20 years.
 i have plans in place to do this in my country

 therefore i need your help to achieve this great feat. i have plans in place that will make this a
 success. i have already moved $250 million into the united states since i was a little girl
 and now i have it all handed to me!
 the federal government is forcing my mother out of the united states to avoid defaulting her loan. my father was a subsdiary agent of the federal bureau of investigation (fbi).
 he died in the operation to subdue the marxist rebels in california.
 subsequently
 the federal government has been forcing my brother-in-law to hand over all documents relevant to this transaction to the international accounting standards board (ianab) for possible currency and ownership discrepancies.
 this transaction with regards to our federal government grants us total control of our federal government
 control.
 i have been using this money for
 these past 15 years or so and i still have not come up with a good
 use for it
 other than as a last resort to pay for my sister and myself to visit her in retirement.
 when i receive this money i will give it to you with open arms
 as a huge financial gift to you and my only wish is that you will bear with me on this
 most important transaction in my life
 i will provide you with a good bank account to transfer the money into
 after my death

 i have been awaiting your urgent response and i want you to know that this is an urgent matter.

 if you are not interested in this transaction
 kindly reply immediately to confirm my proposal and i shall be glad to help you.
 i always look for foreign partners who can help me with this money because iraqi refugees are usually poor and desperate people. i hope that this will not be a problem for you because i am sure that you will be a good partner and someone who will be willing to help iraqi refugees and also help me transfer this fund to your account.
 the situation in your country is different from that of us in europe and we cannot transfer our money over the line without some kind of authorization from the government in your country.
 my wish is that you will not let me down and have confidence in me because i am a foreigner and i have been expecting this money to be for me for so long. 
 please reply immediately to my email address and i will be glad to assist you.

 i am dr suleman muhamede from the northern part of burkina faso.i want to seek your assistance after my discovery during auditing in my bank as am the manager of bill and exchange at the foriegn remittance department of bank of africa
(b.o.a.) in my department we discovered an abandoned sum of usd$10.8million us dollars in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family in plane crashes 2000

 since his death
 we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and 
 claim his money because we can not release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking and financial policies but unfortunately all the efforts proved abortive.
 it is therefore upon this discovery that i decided as the head of my 
 ""department to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we dont want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bills.""
 do not view this as been illegal but an opportunity for us to help enrich 
 our hope in life instead of the bank converting this much money to the 
 security funds.you should not nurse any atom of fear as all required 
 arrangements have been made for the smooth transfer of this funds and your acceptance is what will crown this effort.
 we will conclude this operation within 14 banking days based on the amount of coperation you will contribute.
 thank you for your understanding as await your urgent response to enable me give you more details.please reply with those informations below so as to know you very well before i can go ahead with you.please reply via (sule@surimail.com)

 i have also made some phone contacts in iraq to arrange for some help.
 most importantly it is my father�s time. when my father was alive he killed his bank manager and deposited $500 million (twenty eight million u.s. dollars) in a bank.
 the money is still with me and i hope you will help us in this our request. i have a confession i made to my father that will change his mind. i have a 
 hard time swallowing and i can barely go. i tell myself 
that if i do not do this a thousand times i will be killed.
 i have a vow to carry out this life saving act in my father's name
 and myself. but unfortunately my breath catches in my throat and i cannot go down alone. i have also been injected with a poison that will kill me completely if taken seriously. i do not want a repeat of my earlier 
offence.

twenty five years ago this month
 a rebel with a gun and a knife was shot to death in the rebel-held city of mytilene in the rebel-controlled sierra leone.
on october 31
 2000
 the federal security service of sierra leone (fss) arrested the late brigadier general saki christiano koroma and his wife in a bank in mytilene, the capital city of sierra leone.

upon his release
 the head of the bank was convinced that koroma was acting on his own accord and used the money to purchase a new gun and a new identity card for the next of kin.
the bank issued koroma with a security clearance and upon his release
 he deposited the money in his account for security reasons.
 though koroma was not very wealthy
 he was able to secure a lucrative security clearance and the help of a lebanese security company (lssc).
 this is because of the supposed immunity of the security company and the fact that koroma did not hold any bank accounts in the former soviet union.
 this is the main reason why koroma was released from the security clearance and the security company is helping to secure the money.
 based on the security company guidelines
 they will give the money to a family member for safe keeping.
 koroma was only 17 years of age when he was brutally murdered by his family.
 after his death
 koroma was relocated to mytilene state to live with his relatives.
 before his death
 koroma told his relatives that he was going to seek a new life in the united states.
 before his death
 koroma said that after his death he will seek a foreign partner in order to open a new business in the united states.
 according to koroma
 ""i will seek for a foreign investor who can offer a high quality of life and a good deal of security clearance and reliable foreign partner to make the investment.""
 due to the nature of the transaction
 the security company will not let go of the deal and the money is for me.
 since koroma died without making a will
 i dont want to lose anything by giving him the money.
 i will like you to contact me on my private email address when you reach the correct address given for you.
 you will be required to act fast as the security company will require a minimum of five percent of the funds to execute the transaction successfully.
 if you agree to assist us
 please reply immediately to my private email or i will send you a private message with your private tel. and fax number.
 before you proceed
 please note that this is only a first stage in this business. we shall need your assistance to get this money into your hands.
 please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this is very serious for both of us. i look forward to your urgent reply through my private email.

""the amount of money is due as joint account arrangement between the two parties. the amount of money is based on a percentage agreed upon by both parties during the notification process. this percentage must not be different from the statutory statutory percentage for the joint account. the department is aware of a proposal by the treasury department which would confine this account to the amount of the payment to be paid in full for legal effect to be had on the part of the department and the trust company to treat this money as joint account. we have decided to seek for a foreign partner with legitimate authority who will enable the government of the united states of america to claim the funds as the official account of the branch that controls the accounts and does not have any interest in the funds.

 dear friend

 i am a legal practitioner in u.a. who
 has been in the diamond and mining industry since 2003. i have acted as the auditor in the original complaint to the tune of usd 14.5m
 which i lodged with my local branch. i have been in this business since 2003
 and have been involved in the diamond and mining industry for over 40 years now
 and i have a very good understanding with my colleagues over the amount of usd 14.5m
 which we have both been auditing. i have decided to act as the auditor to the tune of usd 14.5m
 because it is my duty to act as the guardian angel of this business and i am convinced that the trust of god will not let such an innocent act of temptation get in the way of the successful execution of this great project
 and that god will protect us all
 from those who would seize this business opportunity.
 furthermore
 i have decided to act as the beneficiary of the money
 because there is no other way to receive this money than by the hand of god.
 i will make all legal documents to back this up and claim the fund.
 i am ready to give any assistance you give me to help you claim the fund.
 if you are inclined to help
 please reply immediately via my email: etchell@myway.com or call me immediately via remand.

 because of the high level of trust that must have developed between us. i am also ready to provide any other assistance that you will require in the event that you do not like the deal executed.

 you must forward an account exchanged from the account where the account is. you must then (on request) bid on behalf of the owner of this bank any amount you may deserve per year you must also advise the bank on how to make this work fine.

 we proceeded this business as follows it is hoped that you will not hesitate to contact us if you have any question
 or suggestion
 please email us your telephone number or email and we will forward it to you as soon as we have gathered the necessary information
 i.e you have been identified as the owner of the banking and financial ministry
 and you are presently in the process of transferring this fund to your account in this bank
 to avoid any overstatement.
 we would like to hear from you about your visit
 please include with your response what you had to say to get the word out to the
 bankers in this business
 the reason for the delay.
 what was the bank statement for? $17
500
000.00 united kingdom dollars (u.$. )
let me start with the statement of fact. i am a highly placed official of the united kingdom government and also a founding member of the peoples democrataic party (pdp)
which is the ruling party in power now
 in this country. 
 i have been receiving highly placed government officials including the prime minister as well as the chief of police as well as the chief of the social security bureau (ssb) as well as receiving highly placed private telephone numbers as well as top secret state department cables that are still under construction. 
 my dear beloved and colleagues
 as you can see from the beginning of this letter which has been prepared by a top secret united kingdom government government department (dod) security company
 a security company is a security company that is used by the us government to protect its overseas financial systems
 i.e. foreign contracts for goods and services being executed in this country.
 i am a founding member of the peoples democrataic party (pdp) which is ruling in this country
which is the ruling party in this country.
  the word ""pdp"" here is derived from the greek for ""power"", and from that point on
 until today
 all political parties in this country have been completely silent on this subject.
 so here is the important fact.
 the word ""pdp"" comes from the middle english peccatum and means ""to provide for"". hence the middle english peccatum.
 hence the middle dutch pecunia and from that point on
 until today
 all political parties in this country have been completely silent on this subject.

therefore this text of the above request is to be treated with utmost secrecy and confidentiality.
 i am presently working in a foreign country
 like yours
 called
 africa
where i have a sick mother
 who is from ivory coast
 who is required to make a living
 by selling her husband
 by and for us
 through business.
 my husband is a diamond user in this country
 and a self proclaimed democrat.
 he has donated more than $1 million to our country since he was a toddler
 and still no one knows about this deal
 because nobody wants to invest this money in this country
 because nobody wants to give it away to a person who is customer ready
 and still in the early years of life
 confided in me
 my husband works for a security company
 and he has a client who is looking for a hundred thousand united kingdom dollars (us$1
500

  my husband was a big money man in the southern part of the world. as a result he died along with his family in a plane crash on january 27 1998. on the 5th of january 2000
 a british airways concorde 55 carrying a huge sum of money crashed into the atlantic ocean off the coast of norway killing all aboard. on the way to his hotel
 where he was residing alone

he informed the flight attendants of the crash and the passengers. the plane rammed into the atlantic ocean and crashed. the owner of the plane is a very wealthy man named sir francis von kolk
 and the proceeds were only an investment
 the passengers and six crew on board were badly injured. i am afraid that the financial and political instability in my country could not have been avoided without the assistance of some of my close friends.
  majority of the proceeds were originally been paid to the british airways corporation by my late husband for safe keeping. with the help of some of my close friends
 the money was moved to a security company in luxembourg where the money was secured for safe keeping.
  i have decided to donate the money to charity because the money was moved from a secure security company to a security company here in your country. please do not be surprised if the money gets into the hands of some of the rich people in your country as well as some of the privileged.
  i am contacting you for assistance because of the huge amount of money that is in my reach and control. i am 80% certain that the funds were remitted to a foreign bank account where the safe keeping would be kept pending the decision of the security and finance committee of the european union (deutschland) on whether to approve or reject the remittance.
  if you are interested
 please reply immediately via my private email address. i have already extended my contact information with the security and finance committee. i want you to be very considerate and diplomatic when it comes to this important business.
  i want to hear from you in due course.

 now closed due to the political unrest in syria
 and the supposed subsequent confiscation of the farm by the government. the information contained here is based on my research. as i have not been to the farm before
 i was not aware that the farm is still under construction and the farm is being operated under a civilian contractor. i am contacting you to seek your consent to be the
 consultant to help me present a viable option to the government and the lebanese people as to the feasibility of the purchase of the new farm and to make the necessary investment in the farm if this be approved. the information contained here is based on my research and my understanding of the situation.
 my client is a highly paid security and information officer for gulf development bank in the lebanese republic of
 which is under attack by the rebel group isis/il-f. he is on a routine inspection mission to the
 inspected the farm but discovered that the farm is now under construction and the contractor is a civilian. now that the funding for the farm has been secured and the contractor is
 told to make the payment in full by the bank by indicating his/her bank account in the republic of
 which is under attack by isis/il-f. i strongly believe that if the government does not act now
 this money will be wasted on the rebels and the people of the republic of iraq and help them to repress the uprising.
 my proposal is that we should meet and have a very private phone call to discuss about financing and working together to make this happen.
 this transaction poses serious political and security risk as the country that was overthrown from power
 has been in chaos and mass uprising for over a decade now
 both the government and the rebels
 led by president anwar sadat. the government has been using chemical weapons on the civilian population since the start of the year
 and the rebels have been using chemical weapons on the civilian population since the start of the year
 both of them have been busy trying and getting as much as they can from the west and south for their political and economic advantage. however
 the government and the rebels have been putting more and more weight on the west and south
 and gotten more and more powerful
 and has gotten more and more control over the lives of the people
 as the ratio of the west and south now to the west now is about 103 to 103
 with south about 34 to 36. note that the ratio of the west to south now to the west now to the south is only about 34 to 36.
 searching for a trustworthy individual that will be trustworthy to deal with with his/her own responsibilities.
 i am contacting you because i am interested in assisting in the transfer of funds into your account. to achieve this we must all agree to work together to distribute the money to one another. please kindly assist me in this regard
 i am a reputable individual and have the resources to handle this alone.
 on our way to the bank i was informed by one of the officials that the un general assembly is coming to discuss with us. the money was deposited in a bank in dakar -sana a city in south and west africa. i have decided to make the request for your assistance and cooperation to enable me establish a viable joint venture with you
 the person in charge of the bank account. if you are capable and willing to help
 you can do business with me.
 i have arranged for you to meet me in dakar with my deposit paperwork and percentages for deposit. the money will then be shifted to my account in your country.

dear friend

 i am mr.abid jameel mbala
 the managing director of nigerian investment authority (niaa). based on my clearance
 i have decided to seek for your assistance to invest in your country.
 i am now embarking on the process of transferring $35.6 million usd (us$36.6 million) into my nominated foreign bank account here in nigeria.
 i have been contacted by a foreign bank to invest this money in your country for investment.
 i have been diagnosed with cancer
 and upon my diagnosis
 i was diagnosed with esophageal cancer and after a few weeks my life was 
 lost in a plane crash on the plane. i am still in hospital on 
 and have a very good doctor present in my country.
 i got your contact through a mutual friend who was a former diplomat in our country. i have set about to find a foreign partner who will be better able to handle this money which i am considering for investment and i am waiting to hear from you. the next step i am seeking for is for you to be my partner and i will be your co-partner in investing this money into your country. i have decided to use this money to invest my life savings in your country.
 however
 i am afraid that this money will be stolen from me because i have been diagnosed with esophageal cancer.
 i will be afraid of all the press and media after this
 i am afraid that if i dont act fast on this proposal
 my life will be in danger because of the money.
 i am ready to assist you in any way. i am contacting you because i am interested in a legitimate and profitable business opportunity in your country. 
 i am expecting your urgent reply through my email address below. i will be anxiously waiting for your co-operation to enable me make the right decision on this transaction.

 i also decided to seek for a foreign partner because i am afraid that if i are not righted in the right way by the bank then they will confiscate my deposit and charge me anywhere from 10% until 65% of the total deposit will be for me.
 i also decided to seek for a foreign partner because i am afraid that if i am not righted properly by the banking law that will render me not able to apply for a new job anywhere in the world as soon as i apply for a new job.
 considering the fact that the republic of bulgaria does not have a banking law that guarantees the safety and well-being of its depositor
 i am afraid that they will quickly lift the ban on my application for a new job and i will be out of the country pending my application for another.
 i also decided to seek for a foreigner because i am afraid that if my application is approved by the bank that will take care of the rest
 the money will be remitted to the bank unharmed.
 i also decided not to disclose the amount to anyone
 because i am afraid that if i did disclose the money to anybody
 it would be taken out of my name as the owner and all the documents that will be needed for my claim to be realized.
 my only regret is that i did not do this because i am afraid that i would be arrested by the security forces of bulgaria for trying to undermine the presidential will of the country. this is because the security forces have confiscated my computer hard drive and hard-drive for safe keeping. i am not afraid of death
 because i am a very good person and if there were any danger of my life
 i would give it all away to you. please keep this in mind when you apply.
 i will be contacting you through my alternative email for further details.
 yours sincerely.

i am mr. matthew abbasin
 a staff accountant with the international consortium of investigative journalists (icij). i have a very confidential and very confidential business proposition for you.
 on january 6
 1999
 a group of british nationals (abbasin) invaded and took over a residential property in abidjan cote d ivoire
 and took over an individual (mamadou sissi) account. i did not expect this kind of thing to happen
 and i am very sorry for taking this opportunity to make this proposal. i was only twenty-one at the time of the incident
 but i was able to contact my past employers and obtain a foreign partner
 because i am the only son of late mamadou sissi who was the head of pr for a major bank in abidjan.
 the money was originally from my late husband
 which was worth a little more than us$15
000
000.00 (ft.f)
 which was deposited with a major bank in abidjan in the bank security deposit box.
 now that my husband is gone
 i can no longer go out and live my present life because the money was deposited with a major bank
 and the security deposit box (us$15
000
000.00) they have all been lying on for the past twelve months.
 i am really sorry for taking this opportunity and am very glad that you took it this way. i have unfortunately been in this business before
 because i am very good at dealing with relatives and friends.
 i am also very good at investing because i have a very good balance in the bank that i will part with as collateral if the bank does not provide me with the money.
 finally
 i have decided to go into exile in tunisia to avoid any further embarrassment for myself
 as i am not a danger to the whole world or my family
 as i have said before
 to do this deal with you. please regard this as a personal deal only and do not take any action which might affect my future
 endeavours to live a peaceful and kind life.
 i am ready to give you a good negotiable percentage for your assistance if you respond by e-mail.
 thanks and regards.

it is with great sadness that i shall present you with my personal account at http://www.akron.com/commissioneditors/email/
 i was a contractor with akron oil and gas corporation in nigeria for 31 years and my late husband was on the oil and gas committee of the nigeria

 i was once the prompt and sincerely seeking your assistance to assist me and my late husband during the time of political crisis in my country that were ravaging all over the nation.
 i took this decision because my late husband was still alive and the people of my country were suffering.
 i have decided to use this money to purchase and equip a motorway motorway motorway capable vehicle for the passengers of which is to be made to you under your direction and management;
 you and i are to be paid for the purchase of the vehicle through a percentage of 25% for each share of the money (us$7.5 million) paid out to you and 5% is for expenses incured during the course of the project.

0.9302376739921737,1.9489271408768052,0.9761208765116015,"nited nations (reuters) - a rebel leader in northern nigeria has been declared dead after he was shot dead by security forces on a routine security inspection visit to a hospital in lagos-nigeria state, officials said on friday.

he was identified by medical experts as mohammed ibrahim ateeq awad who was a member of the military government of president goodluck jonathan of the southern state of lagos-nigeria.
the medical experts said that awad had died from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head and that a subsequent investigation by medical experts had proved that he had no known family members to support the claim of death as the only known surviving son from the war in the country and therefore did not inherit the sum of $286 million
 ($420 million).
the medical experts said that because of the way the health of the president and the security services have been putting together over the past few years
 the security forces have not been able to locate any family member to carry out inheritances or transfer any property
 as the security code of ethics in south africa is strict and if a family member is not found to be a permanent resident of south africa
 the security forces will not be able to stop the family or transfer any property
 as the security forces have not been able to transfer any property at all to any international organisation that shares the same name as the security forces and that will act as his personal security company
 officials said.
the security forces have not confirmed the death to be a suicide and have not operated on any other relatives since the war in the country started in 2003
 but the fact that the security forces have not established any other relation to the president and his family
 has made the security forces decide to not inform anyone about the death since they are not supposed to know about the security forces.
""a medical doctor from the southern country who was with us in nigeria said that he saw no other relation to the president other than the security forces in the capital city city,"" a senior official said.
the security officials said that since the start of the war against the rebels in the southern states
 the security forces have not recognised any other relation to the president and his family
 unlike the security forces in south africa
 all the family members that have been declared dead or declared unserviceable
 the security officials said that since the beginning of the war in the southern states
 the security forces have not recognised any other relation to the president and his family
 unlike the security forces in south africa
 all the family members that have been declared dead or declared unserviceable
 the security officials said that since the beginning of the war in the southern states
 the security forces have not recognised any other relation to the president and his family
 unlike the security forces in south africa
 all the family members that have been declared dead or declared unserviceable
 the security officials said that since the start of the war in the southern states
 all the family members that have been declared dead or declared unserviceable
 have been relocated to a private hospital in lagos-nigeria.
 ""all the family members that have been declared dead or declared unserviceable
 has been relocated to a private hospital in lagos-nigeria. i am afraid that all the relatives that have been declared unserviceable will go into the hospital alive or be rendered unserviceable in the future. ""
 the medical experts said that after the relocation of all the family members to a hospital
 the security forces will not let them in.i have urgent and very confidential business in the bank. if you are interested
 please reply immediately via my private email address. i shall then send you a private message when i reply. i shall require your assistance to enable me pay for the hospital and other expenses that the security forces have declared unserviceable. ""
 i will also need your assistance to open the bank account that the security forces have declared unserviceable. ""
 please reply immediately. i shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the details better. i shall require your cooperation to enable me open the account. please treat with absolute confidentiality. i shall require your utmost assistance to enable me open this account. i shall require your utmost cooperation to enable me open this bank account. please reply back immediately to my email address if you are interested.

to look for an oversea trusted partner in whose account we would transfer the fund hence the reason for this mail.

i am a resident of abidjan
 in the neighbouring country of ivory coast .
 my late husband was a general in the 1st portuguese general army.he was killed in our country three years ago this year .
 i have a nephew from when he was still alive called ""philip"" (hearted).
 my father was a general in sierra leone african union until his death.
 he was a highly paid and paid political party man in sierra leone.he was assassinated by the rebels following the political uprising.
 my mother works for the un but misses her husband.
 he was a key player in instilling in us the values we cherish today.
 we have decided to call him philip because he is always there for us when we need him the most.
 he was assassinated by the rebels following the political uprising.
 my sister-in-law and i are presently in refugee camp in abidjan called lesinai gobi.
 we have decided to name the camp after him because of the incredible feat we have achieved in our field of endeavor.
 we have already established that the area around the lesinai gobi desert is home to over 12 million trees.
 this means that every day for the past few years
 we are able to gather enough money to buy a house in this remote part of the country.
 we have been able to deposit enough money to cover our monthly electricity bill of $10.00/month.
 this is an incredible amount considering the fact that we are still in our late thirties and early sixties.
 we have been using the lesinai gobi desert for over 15 years
 and still have not come up with a good name for ourselves.
 this is because we are not allowed into the country
 we are staying with our brother-in-law.he is a major in the 1st sierra leone african union.he was killed in our country three years ago because of the rebels fighting us.
 we are waiting for your urgent response.
 we have been buying a house in this remote part of the country for over 15 years
but now that we have decided on the right name for our dear brother
 we cannot go inside.
 we are afraid of the rebel will come and take us.
 but we are too late. we have already established that the area around the lesinai gobi desert is home to over 12 million trees.

 on further investigation
 i discovered that the owner of this directory is a highly paid officer of the russian federal security service (fsb) with a huge amount of cash in his possession. this officer has been in the security service for twenty-five years and is the only one that could have made this deposit on his own.
 this officer is a man of few words. he is known to me for his hard work and determination when he tried to get this deposit made with a confidential directory directory for the benefit of all of us.
 my investigation proved to me that this officer is a man of few words and that if he did not act immediately and with absolute confidence as the chief of security service to the president of the republic of the free world in charge of this deposit which he deposited with a confidential directory directory for the benefit of all of us
 we could have made a huge success.
 i therefore made further investigation and discovered that the chief of security service to the president of the republic of the free world did not give a single word to me. i have decided to contact you as it is the most important contact i will have over you and i have agreed to put together this letter to give you a good indication as to exactly what kind of man he is and how he got here.

my name is miss anna nasser
 i am the owner of a residential property in gaza
 the nature of which is one of the chief principles of our country.
 i made the proposal to my son-in-law mohammed atta to relocate to a certain locality in the west bank and he refused to accept this proposal because of the nature of the proposal.
 this is because according to the law of the land
 mohammed atta is the son of the late mohammed atta and the current leader of the armed group that controls the west bank
 the current leader is a british citizen of iraqi descent named abu musab al-hussein. this means that while in power he secretly planned a terrorist attack on the west bank and the subsequent chaos here in the west bank
 he still kept a secret plan to kill the leader of the armed group that controls the west bank and claim the money from the british overseas.
 this is because in his plan
 he made the proposal to his son-in-law mohammed atta that he and his family and his only surviving son
 would go into exile in the west bank and be with him until his death. this is because the british government does not allow such things in the country and he is the only son of a british citizen living in the west bank.
 since the death of my father
 i have maintained a strict watch over his every step and every communication
 and only keep secret the content of the telex i sent to him. i have refused every request of any foreign partner to come over to his country to live with me
 believing that this would be detrimental to their relations with me.
 my only hope of survival here is because of the instability here in the west bank and because of the terrorist attack that took place on the american diplomatic mission here in kenya on the 9th of november 2001.
 this is because of the presence of the british and because of my countrymen protecting me from all attacks.
 hence
 i have decided to contact you as the only surviving son of the late mohammed atta
 because if you do not accept my offer of giving you up your job as my only son
 i will take all necessary measures to ensure your survival. please kindly help me because i am willing to do anything to help you
 i am in no position to take any action that would put you in danger.
 please reply me to confirm my interest and to confirm my commitment to you.

 the war crime tribunal has found me out that i did not declare any assets in my will and all my assets under management in london were in london. this means that all my money will be in london and no one will be held responsible for the supposed chemical attack on the civilian areas by the rebels.
 i have declared all my assets and i will not let anyone else in london or any other british city and my only desire is to continue on as the leader of the rebel movement kenyatta abacha.
 my only hope of survival is to be overthrown immediately because if i am not overthrown the war will continue.
 the only hope left is to go into exile in a new and better country with a different political ideology and ideology to the one i am in now. 
 ""i will not give up hope of survival because i will not let go of hope of survival if i do not go into exile immediately. my only hope of survival is to be overthrown immediately because i am not a big man and will not let go of anything.""
 my only hope of survival is to be overthrown immediately because i am not a big man and do not have any money
 or will give any.
 i will like you to stand in as my next of kin and my only hope of survival is to go in and live my life as if i was with you. this is simple. i will require you to sign a release form with me that you will make a transfer of money into your bank account for investment.
 i will require your full name
 address
 telephone number and a bank account in your country that will handle the entire transfer.
 i am willing to give you 2% of the total sum for your assistance and 5% for any other expenses that you may have.
 there is no risk at all as all the necessary approvals and approvals for this transaction have already been granted.

i came to china to study law but was arrested a few days ago for leaving the country for debt bondage. i have been locked in a customs and tax cage for over a year now. i can no longer go out nor do anything. i am in terrible shape. i have a staph infection that will be for the foreseeable future. i have been taking medicine for the past few weeks but my body is already boiling. i am in a federal hospital in xiamen. my husband, a contract worker from our traditional country died recently in xiamen.
 we have 103 other citizens in xiamen.

 my husband is a general in the xiamen army. he was killed in our military camp two weeks ago.
 my husband is presently in terrible straitjoints. he is being treated like an unimportant baby.
 the xiamen government has not done anything to help us. my husband is being forced into a terrible bondage that will leave him with terrible health problems. i am in terrible need of a foreign charity worker. i have been given the false hope of one day being the last surviving son or daughter of the late general. but i have not been able to come up with a suitable person to do this for me. there is nobody in this country who can be my brother or sister-in-law but i am sure that if i am not the last surviving son or daughter of the late general i will never have any one to be my brother or sister-in-law. this has terrified me so much i have decided to give up and give up writing for a foreign country. i am writing now for a lucrative business relationship and i think that will give me a huge boost in the near future. i have already met with over 50 international organisations and established trusted contacts in the international banking and investment associations. i am writing now for your country as a civil servant and individual soldier for our country. i want you to help me in every way possible to ensure that i have a life that will last for many many many many many more years to come. for your assistance and your indomitable will. i offer you 30 million won from the sale of this business together with all payments made to me to be made to you by you in the years to come. for your assistance and your indomitable will. i would like the money to be managed in a profitable manner preferably a
 joint venture business with you if possible. 
 subsequently
 you will be required to: 1) assist me in making a profit from the sale of this business; and 2) assist me in growing and maintaining a healthy business in this country.

hello and welcome to another of my weekly emails
 
 i am dr. andrew gopnik
 a health care consultant who has been with the international chamber of commerce and industry since 1998
 i am the president of the chamber of commerce and industry here in guangdong province
 guangdong province. i am the co-founder and ceo director of internet and payment company citi bank
 my company is based in guangdong province and we operate in china with a branch in shenzhen and over the years have operated in over 30 countries
 but finally we decided to close our accounts abroad because of the tension in the region. i have decided to seek for a new life in china after years of wasting my time here
 mainly because of the country's economic difficulties.
 i have decided to seek for a reliable foreign partner for investment in my country
 which is a good thing considering the situation because i am afraid that the country may be seized by the chinese
 which is what we are about to discuss about.
 to this end
 i have decided to contact you with a proposal worthy of your attention.
 i have decided to offer you a 20% commission of any sum (us$15
500
000.00) we have spent so far as clients or foreign partner in a major investment company in your country
 and 20% will be for expenses we both have incurred since 1998 when we were both clients and clients together.
 we have already invested this sum of us$15
500
000.00 in major investment companies in your country and the balance has been duly paid into your account.
 this arrangement is in my view the most lucrative one because the money we have been working on is worth a lot more than the money we have left over for investment.
 the co-operation of all the staff and contractors in place is so absolute
 that nobody will ever have to deal with the co-operation of all of them.

 foundering a business that will live on
 in my heart
 my dream is to be a director in the federal government
 canada
 canada
 where i have so many contacts
 i need your help to get going. i 
came into this business to make a living as an orphanage
 but unfortunately. i did not have any money to spend on my family
 i decided to donate this money to an orphanage in iraq
 where i have lived for the past 6 years
 making this a successful business. i want you to help me in this life and in the future. please.
 this proposal is for you
 i am fatou mohammed 
21 years old. i have a very serious medical condition that needs urgent attention. i have been fighting for my life for my brother to have a legitimate father.
 when my brother was alive he disappeared into the bush with the help of my brother's close friend.
 when we got there he lost his hand and hand were shattered.
 when we got there he also lost his hand and hand were in a bank box. there is no way for me to transfer the money i have in my account to an account where i can be guaranteed a good fee of $
 20% will be given to you and 20% will be given to you from my bank.
 you will be given a contract called an ""agreement of partnership for the maintenance of brotherly trust.""
 the agreement guarantees that all expenses will be borne by me at current pace.
 i give myself full credit for the extra 5% which i got from you my manager. i never give up since we are still fighting for my life. my aim is to be a major in the military service in iraq and a iraq freedom party (mukhabarat party).
 i believe that by helping my brother live a normal life
 and forgotten my true self before it can happen to you. i give myself free will and leave no stone unturned t"

presently
 that is not what happened.
 my husband
 was a serving director of the côte d´ivoire branch of basf. he died in his sleep recently after taking several weeks leave from working in order to take charge of his family.
 i recently located a letter that he had taken from a foreign authority. the foreign authority was offering him as a partner in as a long as we have not met in person. after looking over the diplomatic cables which reveal to us little about the foreign authority interest we are seeking for this investment
 i realized that this investment is completely legitimate and that he will be a huge help to my life .
 i have been following the political developments in africa for some time now and am even more informed now than before .
 i have been following the political upheavals in europe as well as the arab uprisings in the united states .
 i have had the good fortune to meet a number of leaders and officials of very successful and politically stable economies in africa .
 this article is from the archive of our partner .
 government .
 turn now to embark on a grand project that will bring about a more prosperous and more a nation at risk (nairdo) africa .
 we are looking forward to doing business with you
 and to helping you achieve your dreams

obtaining
 the window happened to you before
 but now it is time for it to go into because the money billed does not go into the banking account unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking and financial policies but unfortunately all the money has been filed in the federal government.
 here is the problem
 because we do not have the funds to pay the official in charge of the federal government account (that is the federal government) we have not accrued any penny since march this year.
 so how can we help you find a better and more peaceful way forward than buying a ticket on to our africa bus every week for the past 6-8 weeks?
 
 by buying a ticket on our africa bus every week
 you will be giving us 20% of the sales price of the week
 20% will be given to the indonesian government and the remainder to the government
 agency that runs the bus
 they will be sending to you a letter of authority that i have
 given to the federal government and they will be the first to know about this deal
 the reason for the 20% is that the government is giving us 1% of the total sales price of the week
 1% will be given to the government and the remaining 5% will be used for operating expenses
 the reason why the 5% is so that we can pay for the bus and for the expenses incured by you during the week
 i want you to be of good assistance to us
 we have been buying bus tickets for over a decade
 we have 12 million
 us dollars (us$11
6
 million) in our accounts.
 the expenses incurred during the year were:

1) salaries (retail price for the year)

2) fuel
 3) telephone and internet (homes)
 4) bank cards

      as we are still in the early 1980s
we had a dispute over a present and a lost and found out the hard way that the present also did not exist
and therefore we decided to donate the present to an individual or company
that can help us find the present and give it back to the family.
 here is the problem. there is no easy way to give back this present to an individual or company that can help
 me give this a final try. i think this will help you in your last breaths to give this a final attention in view of the fact that the security of our lives is at stake.

greeting to you

 i am dr suleman muhamede from the northern part of burkina faso.i want to seek your assistance after my discovery during auditing in my bank as am the manager of bill and exchange at the foriegn remittance department of bank of africa
(b.o.a.) in my department we discovered an abandoned sum of usd$10.8million us dollars in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family in plane crashes 2000

 since his death
 we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and 
 claim his money because we can not release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking and financial policies but unfortunately all the efforts proved abortive.
 it is therefore upon this discovery that i decided as the head of my 
 ""department to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we dont want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bills.""
 do not view this as been illegal but an opportunity for us to help enrich 
 our hope in life instead of the bank converting this much money to the 
 security funds.you should not nurse any atom of fear as all required 
 arrangements have been made for the smooth transfer of this funds and your acceptance is what will crown this effort.
 we will conclude this operation within 14 banking days based on the amount of coperation you will contribute.
 thank you for your understanding as await your urgent response to enable me give you more details.please reply with those informations below so as to know you very well before i can go ahead with you.please reply via (sule@surimail.com)

 due to be paid to you in 60 days from the date of the due
 deposit with the foreign bank account deposit deposit deposit deposit deposit deposit with your country so that the deposit can be finalized in your favour. this deposit is due by the end of the year. there is a risk that the money will be misused

 because my bank account is in a serious crisis
 the rest of the money will be in your bank account. i have decided to give all the details to you so that you will not fail to effect the transfer. i am 18 years old and have never made a single transfer in this bank before
 which is why i decided to contact you. it is well known that a lot of fathers fail to make a successful start up business and only a few make a huge sum of money
 which they use in the bank. i have decided to give you a good negotiable percentage for your assistance so that we can start the money transfer. unfortunately

before his death
i intended to write a letter of private assistance to the pension fund manager for his efforts in helping to pay for the iraq war. upon reflection, i conclude that he was a worthy individual with a noble cause who deserves the utmost respect and gratitude.
 in response to your letter of private assistance i have been awarded a contract awarded to carry out a project that will benefit the fund manager. the fund manager believes that his investments will be used more effectively in the future if his project is realized successfully than some days ago.
 my reason for granting the contract to you is that the fund manager believes that his investments will be used more effectively in the future if his project is realized successfully than some days ago.
 in the course of executing the project the fund manager discovered a mysterious substance that is known as the ""xanax oil"". i believe this oil to be the oil of the errant substance and therefore the father of all mysterious oil 
 discovered in the oil.
 the fund manager believes that his investment will be realized more effectively if his project is realized successfully than some days ago.
 this process is called secreting the fund and the fund is to be distributed among some number of family members or friends who will benefit greatly from the secreting.

 i am a self proclaimed champion of the west african champion.i am the son of the late president of west africa charles taylor
 and my father (madam zimbabwe) was assassinated on the 31st of october 2002
 with his wife and their three children. 
 i am writing to seek your urgent assistance in transferring the money into your account through the name of my father
 which i have assured you will be correct.
 i am contacting you because i am interested in investing the money in a profitable business.i have several options that i would like to discuss.
 first
 i am the son of the late president charles taylor and my father is a champion of the west african champion.
 i am interested in investing the money in a profitable business in east africa. 
 since my father died
 i have focused on the education of my son. i have also focused on the business of my late father
 which i share with my mother. 
 i have been very partial to my father because he was a very good man but after his death
 we have decided to transfer the fund to your account for investment purposes.i have several options
 including
 1)to divide the money into a single
 fixed sum or
 2)to give it to charity organizations and other worthy people abroad whom i will want to invest the money in. i have been able to help some of my mothers
 and fathers relatives
 which have been hopelessly lost in the database. 
  this is due to the fact that my fathers position is in the government
 where i am currently residing. 
 i am seeking your cooperation to help me and my father get the money out of thailand and south africa. 
   if you are interested
 please send your reply to my address below.
 thanking you.
    i look forward to hearing from you soonest.

 my main business venture is to invest in the accounts of foreign investors and to invest the capital in their accounts for investment opportunities.
 my main investment goal is to secure a foreign partner in order to fund my investment plans and to invest the capital in my country for investment opportunities.
 hence i decided to contact you to assist in investing in my country.
 i am in the process of investing the money in a company in south america with a view to investing there for investment opportunities.
 the money will be divided into two parts:
 1. 30% will be for expenses we both anticipate to incure in the investment.
 2. 75% will be for legal and technical help.
 3. 15% will be for the travel expenses and expenses that will incure when the fund is invested.
 i will be contacting you as soon as possible if any hitch in the communication.
 i am still in hospital after a cardiac arrest and have not been able to go outside for a while.
 i have not worked in my entire life so i must be very surprised if this letter does not interest you in the fact that i am making this effort.
 most importantly it is in view of your participation in this transaction that i shall require your assistance to invest the money into your bank account.
 you will be contacted through my personal email address:sarah@geocities.com
 please keep this in mind if you do not agree with this proposal. i am not a big supporter of money transfer and it is my duty as a non-conformist to negotiate with you to enable you into the bank account.
 i will need your assistance to enable me transfer the money to your nominated account into your nominated account with 5% of the total money for interest and 5% for reputational and safety reasons.
 i will require your full co-operation in accommodating this huge and lucrative project and also your assistance in accommodating the anticipated expenses of the fund transfer.
 given the nature of this transaction and the urgency of this transaction 
 i need your honest co-operation to be the next of kin of the deceased so that i can inherit the property i have just inherited from my late husband
 which was a former diplomat with the russian government.
 this transaction is totally risk free and all the details will be worked out on your behalf by me.
 i have decided to contact you as a foreigner only because of your co-operation in accommodating this huge and lucrative project that my government is proposing to my government.
 with the necessary information you will derive an agreement to make this happen for me and my colleagues and myself.
 be assured that this transaction will be smooth as no one will ever claim the fund from this fund that i have deposited in my account.
 i am ready to provide you with more details and more detailed instructions for how and where to go to make this happen.
 please reply to me as soon as you receive this mail so that i will send you the full contact information of the bank in your country for easy communication.

this is my first and only time writing to you. i was asked to write a letter to you because i am sorry for not contacting you before the death of my late husband on the 12th of january 1998.
 i am writing to request that you kindly assist me and my late husband in the purchase of a new home in your country
 because we are in a very bad contract situation.
 i shall be glad to hear from you if you will be willing to assist me and my late husband
 because we have the greatest wealth in the world. we were both born into an american family
 and we discovered our shared wealth when our late father died in a plane crash on the 14th of october 1998.
 we now have very little money and have decided to take this decision based on the fact that our husbands life is now in danger because of lack of security in this country.
 we cannot afford to wait any longer. because of this
 we are in the position of having no other viable alternative.
 although i know that this letter could be very bad for you
 but only if we are willing to make this kind of arrangement with you.
 we are in fear of our husbands death because of the security situation in this country
 which is unfortunately being brought to our notice by the government of president
 
 president mohammed
 who has declared war on the opposition and the u.s.a.(u.s.a) for the coming of the year 2000.
 we are now in a position of being able to afford our husbands live and to maintain the security of our lives. hence we are ready to embark on this risky business of buying a new home in your country.
 
 it is very important that you understand that we will need you to invest our money towards investment in your country
 which is presently under the control of an international organization
 which is hostile to our interests and to our security.

i am not aware of any other country in the world that does not employ a security firm that covers embassies in your country. my company did this work for me and during the time when the money was still lodged with the security firm.

 i also learnt that he is a british citizen and that the british government is collecting and keeping a huge percentage of the money in frozen accounts in various asian countries.
 i therefore am contacting you to help in the making of this happen but first i need your assurance that the money will be safe and sound money.

 i want you to contact a reputable bank in your country that will enable you claim the funds as your own.
 i have a very good business proposition for you.
 i have a deposit with a reputable bank in china that was made into a security deposit agreement with the federal security administration (fsa). the agreement stipulates that the security deposit must be declared unserviceable by the bank by the end of the year. i need your assistance in this regard because of the nature of the security deposit. i am a foreigner and the security deposit agreement with the federal security administration (fsa) is not approved by the relevant branches in my country. therefore, i have sent a routine reminder letter to all the security deposit contractors in my country in order to make sure that they will not ignore this request.
 i have made several attempts to contact them in your country but they have refused to do so because they do not want to interest any foreigner. i want you to do this because the fact of the matter is that the deposit with the federal security administration is declared unserviceable by the bank by the end of the year.
 i want them to send me a reminder letter with the details of the security deposit and the details of the agreement with the federal security administration in your country.
 i want them to furnish me with a copy of the security deposit agreement signed by the security deposit contractor
 and the details of the security deposit agreement with you
 so that the security engineer will write to you to help you claim the fund.
 i have already done this with the security deposit contractor
 and i want you to do it again because the security deposit agreement is very favourable to you because it gives you immunity from prosecution if you deposit the fund in the bank. i want you to send me a copy of the security deposit agreement with you and give it to me if you are interested but i have no other contact then your phone and fax numbers
 so that i can contact you if you are interested and i will give you the details of the deposit contract with the security deposit contractor.
 i will not fail to make a good investment and this will be my present financial situation.
 i need your co-operation in this regard because the more co-operation we have the more success will be had.

 my dear beloved

        let me start by introducing myself. i am  mr. maekal mekha
 a baghdad citizen
 iraq
 a mechant as an occupation. i have a obscured business suggestion for you. i am a brother to dr.gerald mekha
who worked with 
 iraq judicial commission 
 iraq
 for over a decade before he died on 20th of march in the year 2007.
 he died after a brief  illness that lasted for two weeks. before his death he made a vow to use his wealth for the down trodden and the less privileged in the society. when my brother was alive he deposited the sum of £250 million pounds (two hundred and fifty million pounds) with one united kingdom security company in london.
 this funds are still with the security company for the past 6 years now
the funds are locked in two metallic trunk boxes
 deposited with these company
 i am in a refugee camp here in iraq
 as a result of the war in 
 iraq this moment
 am sorry am not too fine based on my health
though what disturbs me most is my stroke. 
 ""having known my condition and want to make sure i do my fathers will
 i have decided to donate this fund to an individual or company
that will utilize this money the way i am going to instruct herein. ""
 ""i want an individual or company that will use this to fund and provide succor to poor and indigent persons
 orphanages
 and widows and for propagating peace in the universe. i understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. i took this decision because i do not have any one that will inherit this money and my staying in the refugee camp
 still dont know when ill be granted the visa permit out of iraq. i do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner
 hence the reason for taking this bold decision.""
 i do not need any telephone communication in this regard because of my uneasy access to the facility in the refugee camp here in iraq. also because of the presence of social security in the camp
 i do not want them to know. with allah all things are possible.
  as soon as i receive your reply i shall give you the contact information of the security company in london
united kingdom. i will also issue you a letter of authority that will empower you as the original beneficiary of this fund. i want you to always pray for me.
 my happiness is that i lived a life worthy of emulation. whosoever that wants to serve the almighty allah must serve him with all his heart and mind and soul and also in truth. please always be prayerful all through your life. any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for an individual for this same purpose. please assure me that you will act according to my specification herein.
 hoping to hear from you. thank you an"

the security company in question was assisting in the transfer of money from one of their accounts to another account of my country. on the conclusion of the transfer the company members opened fire on the security company and killed him.
 the security company have since investigated and discovered no trace of the supposed 
 fund left over from the incident to my country.
 i have decided to seek for a foreign partner in the embroku-land
 the accounts that were closed as bank investigations revealed no trace of the account 
 to my country.
 the security company have since concluded that the account that was closed is the legitimate account of the security company 
 who then took possession of the funds.
 since the closure of the account
 the security company have been arrested and charged with embezzlement of funds.
 since then
 nobody has come to claim the funds and the funds have only been in my account for a few months.
 since then
 nobody has contacted me to claim the funds.
 i shall rather kill than be audited as a foreign account by the security company than be tried as a bank robber.
 i have decided to seek for a foreign partner in the embroku-land the account that was closed as the account was 
 closed on the recommendation of the security company.
 the security company has now confiscated the funds and transferred them to a reputable account for the time being.

 this is simple because the security company does not care about my safety. i shall rather die than be audited as a foreign account by the security company than be tried as a bank robber.

 for over a decade before he died on 20th of march in the year 2007.
 he died after a brief  illness that lasted for two weeks. before his death he made a vow to use his wealth for the down trodden and the less privileged in the society. when my brother was alive he deposited the sum of £250 million pounds (two hundred and fifty million pounds) with one united kingdom security company in london.
 this funds are still with the security company for the past 6 years now
the funds are locked in two metallic trunk boxes
 deposited with these company
 i am in a refugee camp here in iraq
 as a result of the war in 
 iraq this moment
 am sorry am not too fine based on my health
though what disturbs me most is my stroke. 
 ""having known my condition and want to make sure i do my fathers will
 i have decided to donate this fund to an individual or company
that will utilize this money the way i am going to instruct herein. ""
 ""i want an individual or company that will use this to fund and provide succor to poor and indigent persons
 orphanages
 and widows and for propagating peace in the universe. i understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. i took this decision because i do not have any one that will inherit this money and my staying in the refugee camp
 still dont know when ill be granted the visa permit out of iraq. i do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner
 hence the reason for taking this bold decision.""
 i do not need any telephone communication in this regard because of my uneasy access to the facility in the refugee camp here in iraq. also because of the presence of social security in the camp
 i do not want them to know. with allah all things are possible.

 i am mr.johnson mohammed
 the son of the late mr. mohammed hussein mohammed
 i am writing to seek your urgent assistance to transfer the sum of us$27.3m from my father to your country
 preferably in your country for investment purposes.
 the money was deposited in a security company which my father died in a plane crash leaving behind a huge sum of us$27.3m
 however the security company does not know whether the money has been used in any way as a money transfer or for any other purpose. hence i am contacting you as the father of a child of my late father. i wish to request that you will enable me transfer the sum of us$27.3m into your country for investment purposes.
 i have been anxiously awaiting your urgent response.
 i have been expecting from you for the past year now
 and present danger to our lives because of the current instability in zimbabwe
 and my situation with my mother. i have been expecting for less than a year now now. i am expecting to be released from custody this year. i have been expecting for all kinds of things for the past few years now. i have been expecting for my mothers present safety
 and happiness since i got my mother out of jail for the past few years. my father died on the 14th of december 1998 with a huge sum of money in a security company in a plane crash leaving behind a huge sum of us$27.3m

 this is an urgent reply to ""south africa's most wanted person""
 who died on the 8th of february 2000 in a plane crash on the atlantic ocean. i am a huge supporter of mr. mamou mandera who i have known for some time now. though i was not particularly involved in politics or any political ideology in my early years
i found out about his death from an egyptian businessman and his wife who was killed in the plane crash. i believe that the death of mr. mamou mandera was the result of a drug overdose that he had on the occasion of his death. i therefore made further investigation and discovered that he had died without making a will or claiming any property in all his official documents
 including his bank deposit with the federal reserve bank of south africa. i strongly believe that the release of this money to the people of south africa was the real reason behind his death. however, i have discovered that his wife was not present as she had given birth to son on the last day of his life and that his only source of income came from the diamond and cocoa industry here in johannesburg
 which accounts for more than 70% of his total total assets. i therefore decided to search for a foreign partner in the same country and only obtain the funds for my own benefit from the discovery of his death. i have the power to make this happen and in doing so
 i have secured the release of the deposited fund for me. i have agreed to give out 35% of the total sum to any foreigner interested in investing in my country. i have also made arrangements to meet with the head of government of south africa to negotiate a mutually agreed upon percentage for us to work together on.
 i am requesting that you prepare this document so that the public can understand and accept the fact that i am a huge supporter of mr. mamou mandera. i am proposing that you do everything in your power to ensure that this deal is carried out through the open and honest of your heart. this transaction would be 100% risk-free as no risk at all must occur.
 this transaction would be 100% risky if not for the cooperation of the two of us. i have instructed my attorney to prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will secure the release of the money pending further investigation.
 please reply immediately via this private email address if you are interested in this transaction. i look forward to hearing from you immediately.
 sincerely

 i made the decision to contact you with a proposal regarding the management and management of my company.
 i have decided to contact you on the recommendation of the ceo of the company who told me last week that he is considering leaving the company
 because he is a rebel and does not want his last name used by anybody.
 before my death last year
 i decided to contact you because i am very lonely and can not go outside because of my illness.
 i contacted you because i am interested in buying a new business and this deal with you is a huge help in my confidence because i cannot be out of my present position as the ceo.
 i am a rebel and want to establish myself as a leader in the struggle for true principles in the face of the present system of power and corrupt government in my country.
 what i want to do is conceal this business so that the government will not believe me and i can not be in office for a very long time because of this. i am also interested in buying a property that will let me live in my present position.

0.5661231333944573,2.4431802466681822,0.6239129908874094,"he house of commons has passed a new law that could see asylum seekers placed under house arrest for up to four years. the law will protect asylum seekers said to have been targeted due to their political ideology.
""the act will be passed under the routine notification procedure without any further delay and will also protect asylum seekers said to be targeted during the course of the notification process and subsequent discovery of the asylum seekers asylum claim in the house,"" said a joint statement released by the house of commons and the ministry of justice.
the house of lords has passed a similar law to protect asylum seekers in the past.
""the draft bill contains provisions that would protect asylum seekers who were targeted by the government during the notification process and subsequently discovered to have been targeted by the government. the draft act will protect asylum seekers despite the fact that they are asylum seekers themselves and asylum seekers themselves are not political parties. all forms of political agitation or incitement to political disturbance is a serious concern when it comes to asylum seekers and asylum seekers themselves. i am convinced that this act will be executed under the routine notification procedure without any hitch as asylum seekers are political parties and hence political agitation is a serious concern to the government and its supporters.""
 the draft law will protect asylum seekers according to the following:
 (i) asylum seekers nominated for asylum by the government

(ii) asylum seekers nominated for asylum by the private security service or civilian party
 and (iii) children
 of whom asylum seekers are the main beneficiary.
 ""the draft bills make it unlawful for a family member of a refugee as the guardian of the deceased to apply to the international children's court or any tribunal to have any legal effect on the claim of this family member for whom the money was deposited
 and the proceeds have been shifted to a family member of the deceased. it is my conviction that as the guardian of the deceased and as the private security service i am the only one capable of keeping watch over the fund and this is why the draft is pending in the international children's court.""
 the draft will also protect the family members of the deceased by making it unlawful for them to lodge any claim against the government or any tribunal with respect to this fund.
 the draft law will also protect the family members of the deceased by making it unlawful for them to lodge any claim against the government or any tribunal with respect to this fund.
 the family members will be paid for the information they disclose to the international children's court and will be given 20% of the fund for any miscommunication.
 the proceeds of this fund will be remitted to your nominated bank account where it will be held until the fund is transferred to your nominated account. i shall be contacting the attorney general of the republic of south africa to seek your cooperation and to make the claim of this fund known to the south african government. i shall also be contacting you to seek your consent to be part of the international children's court. i shall also require your full co-operation and your full co-operation in this vital issue.
 i shall require your co-operation in this respect because you are my co-operation in this regard as i am the only one capable of keeping watch over this fund and you have all the legal documents i require. indeed, i shall need your co-operation to get this money into your bank accounts. please kindly assist me in this my co-operation by sharing this blog with you.

 because of the war in iraq. i live in abidjan with my two younger brothers and we have decided to move to abidjan and seek for a new partner in europe
 when the time comes to continue our married life here in abidjan.
 the proposal we have gotten from one of my husbands
 was to give us the land and the other part of the money to invest our own share in the new venture here.
 i have decided that this arrangement would be most profitable because we will be moving in together as one family
 where the money will be divided between us according to the percentages indicated on the contract
 and the investment will be of very high quality.
 i have decided to share the money between us because i am not afraid of anything
 because i am a company manager and this is the only way i can influence the transfer.

i am a british citizen of algerian origin and a resident of ivory coast. i have lived in ivory coast for over 25 years now.
my family were victims of the civil war in my country and i was the first to go into exile. my only wish is to visit you again soon. i wish to visit your country for a business transaction and this time i am interested in investing in your country. my family were fond of associating with name in the investment and decided to invest this money into a company
which they have been holding since the start of the year
 european capital trust bank. it was when we first got information about the existence of the company
that convinced me to make this proposal.
i am interested in investing in your country because of the maturity and success of your company
and the opportunity to continue my education
while still enjoying the fruits of my labor.
 you will be my partner and partner only and i will maintain confidentiality
while i am alive so that the opportunity of making this investment will not come to pass.
 i wish to make this investment in your country because we share the same name
my husband died in the same plane crash as my husband was leaving behind him
 and my husband was badly beaten and badly beaten before he was able to survive the crash. i am sure that the members of my family that perished in the plane crash will also benefit immensely
 they were all liberal
 hardworking people
 and will have gotten along very well with my husband
 since we were both farmers.
 i am prepared to do any act of god to help me
 and i am prepared to do all i can to help you
 otherwise why would you come to my country
 i would not have known you would come to my country if i had known you were here
 and that you would come to me because i am the only one that can do such and such. i would also like you to assist me in getting a new job as i am really looking forward to your help and my country would be very much in your hands. please kindly guide and assist me in making this right as i will be leaving for my son's prom in asia next year.

 hundred and twenty one dollar.
 in a security and trust company. i need your help to get this money out of the security company and into a safe company
 that will be fiscally responsible.
 the funds body will be headed by my financial manager
 who will be helping me invest the money.
 the fund manager and i are seriously looking for a good manager that will be with us when the funds are safe.
 so we came up with the ideal of hiring a financial manager that will be with us when the funds are safe.
 this manager has been taking care of me and recently a 65 year old mother of two from india who has also been missing for more than a week has come forward.
 she has been identified as shelly mayes (65) from abidjan
 a city of more than 12million people here in the south east asia and the indian ocean region. she was last seen alive about 12.15 pm inside a residential house in her native abidjan town.
 she was badly beaten and died as a result of what the police are calling blunt force trauma (during the doctors service pending my request). i have not been informed of her death.
 as we were coming into this country 
we had some documents of a deposit of $ 65.000.000 usd (twenty eight million five hundred thousand usd ) made by my late father in a security and trust company.according to my father
 he intended to use this fund for his international business transaction after his tenure in office but was unfortunately murdered.
 we had located the security company where the money is deposited with the help of an attorney and established ownership.please right now
with the bitter experiences we had in our country and the war still going on especially in diamond area which incidentally is where we hail from .coupled with the incessant political upheavals and hostilities in this country  ivory coast
we desire seriously to leave here and live the rest of our life into a more peaceful and politically stable country like yours hence this proposal and request.
 we therefore wish you can help us in the following regards :
 1)to provide us with a good bank account to transfer the money into 
 2)to help us invest the money into a lucrative business .
 3) to assist my brother get a college admission to further her education.
 ""please i know that
this letter may sound strange and incredible to you but the cnn and the bbc african bulletin  normally have it as their major news features .therefore for the sake of god and humanity give an immediate positive consideration and reply to me via our e-mail address.i will willingly agree to any suitable percentage of the money you will propose as your compensation for your assistance with regards to the above .please in view of our sensitive refugee status and as we are still conscious of our fathers enemies.i would like you to give this a highly confidential approach .""

 i am mr. robert c. wilson
 a contract farmer in orissa in south africa. my late father was a contract farmer here. he died along with his entire family in a plane crash on december 11, 1998.
 though i am not a member of the house of trustees or any other political party
 i did not belong to either the left or the right political parties. 
  my late father was a very wealthy man in orissa and his assets were valued at us$5.5m (fifteen million five hundred thousand us dollars). i am writing you as a compensate for the immense financial compensation i have been given from the us government.this is because of the nature of the current political situation in south africa. 
   the current president nelson ki-sang is a hostile regime in south africa that is seeking to take over the country. president nelson ki-sang introduced a new draft law in the house of representatives that would make it a crime to serve as the face of the government in a foreign country. i am proposing that if you are willing to stand down as the president of the republic of south africa from the republic of south africa and stand as a member of his family below the legal threshold of consignment of funds to the bank accounts of the republic of south africa and the bank of south africa
 you would be able to claim the funds as your own as long as you maintain the following:
 1.  your private telephone and fax number
 2.  your private e-mail address
 3.  your private bank account number
 and your private e-mail. if you are willing to do this
 come over here and discuss with me. 
  i will then give you a good negotiable percentage for your effort and assistance. i will not disappoint you in this regard. you should contact me by e-mail if your interested.

 my goal with this letter is to solicit your cooperation and understanding in the conclusion of which i hope you will not disappoint me. i am mr. solomon menon who was killed in the gulf war on 31st august 2005. i have been fighting in iraq for the iraqi government since the early 2000s. i have been in and out of the army for many years now but decided to seek the retirement of the late general menon because he was one of the few officers on the hill who and led the effort to get the us to surrender. i also have some very important documents in my possession which i am going to use to get his release. the documents are
 a) a british oil consultant with a foreign bank
 who made a mistake depositing his money in my bank and deposited it in a top security company
 ( security company of the year 2000) for safekeeping
 and
 b) a foreigner with british business
 who made a mistake depositing his money in my bank and deposited it in a top security company
 ( security company of the year 2000) for safekeeping and other important documents
 in my possession.
 i am afraid that the information i am about to introduce could do serious damage to my family and perhaps even ourselves if i do not disclose this to you
 as i do not want to risk my seat on the investment buying time. please do not entertain any fear as the security company has already proved itself to be a
 reliable partner
 and they seem to be very honest and professional. on the assumption that you will not give any thought to the safety and well being of your country by leaving this letter out of fear that some of us might be vulnerable. note that this letter is intended to give you a good understanding of the nature of this company and how we came to be here. i am not a professional

dear friend

 i am a very wealthy farmer in abidjan victoria west africa
 living in luxury with my wife and two small children. i have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.
 on the 21st of october 2006
 my late wife and i were hitch-free in a bush in abidjan
 ivory coast. on our way to the hospital
 where we are undergoing our last tracheopy
 we were brutally hijacked and brutally murdered by the local security forces.
 my late husband was a very dedicated farmer and a dedicated father to a fine and very well-loved child.
 having known us since our last communication
 he has always been a dedicated man of principles
 believing that only by believing in the future of all of us can we be successful.
 we have since been together for a very long time
 we have both remained faithful to each other through and through
 and we have both written to the president of the bank to seek his consent to purchase a share of our farm for us.
 after much prayer and effort
 we decided to get married and have a child together. we are expecting a child outside of the next of kin.
 my late husband
 was one of the very few farmers who was very dedicated and committed to the future of all of us.
 he died in a car crash on the 11th of november 2000 in a very serious motorist distress.
 i have decided to send a private message to you because i am afraid that if i were you to meet me you would think i was a lonely man.
 i am very very sick and very badly injured and have not felt well for a very long time.
 i am not a very good person and after a brief illness i decided not seek for help from anyone.
 but now that i have decided to seek for a second chance for myself the hope of having a child with a well-known and very well-loved man
 my life has really gotten out of hand.
 i am contacting you with this urgent proposal because i am very afraid that the death of my husband will bring about the end of my life.
 i am sure that the money you will give me will be enough to continue on in my life and that i will never again have a son or a daughter.
 i only ask that you will give so much because i am in deep crisis and need for urgent help is very real.
 i am very sorry for making this request
 i am afraid of the utter chaos and crisis that is regarding nigeria and other parts of africa
 particularly the parts of south america and asia where terrorism is the norm.
 i am very very grateful for your kind invitation and will give you as much as you are willing to give in confidence that you will not disappoint.
 i have been thinking about going to asia for a period of time and i am not ready to disappoint you.
 i am a ver"

i want to confess that i am a huge fan of the sevenoaks. i have been watching the sevenoaks since they first appeared on the continent in the late 1990s. the sevenoak council decided that all the members of the sevens be relocated to a new continent and the former war dead be placed on at the end of each year.

the sevenoak personality is known to me as the one who controls the situation and the way in which he controls the situation
 because the sevens personality is known to me as the one who controls the tension in the sevens house.
 i have watched with keen interest the development of the sevens personality since he appeared in the media and particularly since the favourable coverage he got from the media.
 my interest in watching the development of the sevens personality has been realized because i have watched with keen interest the development of the sevens personality since he appeared in the media and particularly since the favourable coverage he got from the media.
 i have watched closely with prayerful attention with my colleagues at the bank because i am convinced that the successful transfer of the money to your account will be accomplished by my prayer and the efforts of my colleagues.
 i am ready to give you a good negotiable percentage for your assistance if you agree to do so.
 you should forward this along with any further details you may require immediately.
 i will be happy to give you a good negotiable percentage for your assistance in writing your name and contact information if you agree.

 my dear beloved

      there is a girl i know that i need to marry. she is a 
 girl of about 18 years old. she has a 
 ton of 
 wealth in her bank account and is about to give up her dream of becoming a priest when her 
 father dies. her mother tells me that her father may be ill but he is living with his family in 
 iraq where he has strong personal problems. the family is staying with a friend who has also been helping her get a good quality health care
 that will help her live a life that will last for generations to come.
 the friend has a son named justin who is about to be christened justinella. 
  he is a very brave boy and a rebel soldier in the iraq and afghanistan war .
 he was killed while helping his mother get a good quality health care from an 
 private charity.
 the family is now taking care of two little girls aged 6 and 6 years old.
 the girl who was killed is still alive and well and is in good health. her father may have known about her illness and is trying to help her get a good quality health care package that will live a life that will never be the case in my country.
 this proposal and hope will not be denied.
 but the moment you are informed of the situation in my country 
 give a special pleading letter to the government headquarters in london calling on the armed forces to intervene and save life of the girl's father.
 the armed forces are searching for the father of the girl who was killed
 because her father did not want to give up his present position as the armed forces chief inspector in my country.
 the security forces are searching for the father of the girl who was killed because her father did not want to give up his present position as the security forces chief inspector in my country.
 i give this letter because i am a rebel soldier from sierra leone .

 dear madam/sir
 i am madina tsvetlana tsvetlana
 the former wife of senator
 pascal, i want to seek your assistance after my discovery during auditing in my bank as am the manager of bill and exchange at the foriegn remittance department of bank of africa
(b.o.a.) in my department we discovered an abandoned sum of usd$10.8million us dollars in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family in plane crashes 2000

 since his death
 we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and 
 claim his money because we can not release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking and financial policies but unfortunately all the efforts proved abortive.
 it is therefore upon this discovery that i decided as the head of my 
 ""department to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we dont want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bills.""
 do not view this as been illegal but an opportunity for us to help enrich 
 our hope in life instead of the bank converting this much money to the 
 security funds.you should not nurse any atom of fear as all required 
 arrangements have been made for the smooth transfer of this funds and your acceptance is what will crow"
2.1670140832122615,0.5608724096528532,0.8121530232359154," have been contacted by our local telco to arrange this transaction. i will therefore like you to assist me in transferring the sum of us$100 million.00 (us$100 million) into a foreign account that will be used as a safety net for the family. i will also like you to assist in holding a joint meeting with your family members or any of their relatives as a next of kin. i need your assistance to enable me transfer the amount of us$100 million.00 into your account.this transaction is simple and quick.
  i am writing to you as an individual who has the same interest as you and therefore cannot be moved to any foreign account. thanking you in anticipation for your urgent response.
   i shall be discreet in this matter and await your response
   to enable me transfer this sum to your foreign account.
  i have decided that i will  use a foreign account as a safe medium to transfer this money to a foreigner who is interested in investing the money in your country.
  i will also like to meet with you as soon as possible to discuss about the transaction.
   i am expecting your immediate reply to this letter.

 citizen. i have a son called francis who is 16 years old. he is presently in the third year of high school.
 he was killed when his father's private jet plowed into a crowd celebrating his birthday.
 my father, a contractor-collector-killer who for some reason did not like the way things were going in my country. he had been playing rock n' roll for some time.
 but he did not like the way things were. he had been playing badly and was badly beaten.
 so he decided to give up playing and go into business with the government.
 but he did not know what is called a ""monopoly"" or a ""mandate"" given to him by his government to play rock n' roll.
 so he came up with the lucrative idea of buying a music and publishing company in my country.
 but he did not think it will work out badly in my country because of our flag.
 so he came up with the risky and risky and -

 since my late husband was killed
 he has remained dormant for the past few years.

 his next of kin and this is the reason for seeking for a new name for his deceased kin and we have decided to contact you from the netherlands.
 the netherlands is an absolute treasure and i would like to invest in a valued country like your country.
 i am seeking for your confidence in the future of your family.
 i have decided to invest this money into a worthy investment that will benefit me and my family.
 i want you to invest this money wisely and with good management to enable it to reach our country
 which is at the forefront of internationalization.
 we have the capacity to invest the funds in a foreign account and guarantee the safe-keeping of the funds.
 we have managed to secure a very good arrangement with the bank to be able to transfer this money to your account for investment purposes.
 i have already mapped out a percentage of 75% for you and 80% for me to invest this fund in your country. i cannot wait to hear from you soon!
 i have contacted you deliberately to solicit your assistance in this regard to enable us invest this money in a worthy investment and the success of this proposal would depend on you

 we are currently in the process of transferring this money to your country for investment. we are also interested in a genuine business partnership that will benefit both of us.
 we will be interested to know whether you are willing to work with me on this proposal.
 we are very blessed to have you and i

 i will like to come to your country with my own family to claim this fund and also to invest it in a profitable business venture in your country.
 i am interested in investing this fund in your country because i have confidence in you
 and i want to see your firm in your country. i am prepared to give you 30% of the total sum
 and i have a strong desire to see you in your country someday.

dear friend

 i am
 a married father of two
 and a personal friend of mine. 
 on the 17th of september 2005
 i got an urgent telephone call from a confidante of mine who is a very wealthy and highly regarded businessman who is now out of business.
 the business is very profitable and i got your contact through a personal communication that i have made with a lawyer and i have decided to use this money as the finance and transfer fund to you.
 i am not concerned with the content of the transaction but with the situation in my country.
 i am contacting you to seek for a foreign partner who will be willing to undertake the business of this arrangement for me.
 i have decided to make this investment unfortunately because of this crisis in our country.
 therefore
 i need your assistance to carry out this transaction with you.
 i am a mother of two children and as such
 i cannot handle this kind of situation with my two children as well. 
 i have made this proposal because of the present crisis in our country. 
 the current crisis in our country has exposed the fact that the only thing that can stop this crisis from happening again is the political will of the people. 
 we are presently in the throes of a huge political crisis in our country which is due to remain unrivaled for the next two years. 
 i was told by a foreign diplomat that this money will be used to create a ""asia pacific economic investment bank"" and i have been instructed to prepare a major proposal for you. 
 the problem is that this money is supposed to be used for personal expenses including 
 travel expenses and also investment in your country.
 i am also convinced that you can assist me in making this proposal. 
 i am ready to give you the information about the amount of this money that you can provide
 and i will treat it as your business.
 i want you to know that this business is very risky because the government has to invest the money in a trusted foreign partner.
 hence
 my proposal is to invest this money in your country into a profitable business venture. 
 i am ready to provide you with the details of the transaction so that you can understand the natur"

dear friend

 i am a contracting firm in bangkok where i will be working as a consultant
 without any capital investment
 to a foreign partners investment. this is because the fund will be used to pay down the balance of my clients bill after the contract has been concluded
 and after the balance is paid
 i will be able to transfer this fund for investment.
 the fund is owed to a total of us$14.5million
 which is almost 30% of the total amount owed to me. so we are generous to each other because i am interested in transferring this fund to your nominated bank account.
 i am aware that this does not want my colleagues and i to be in breach of contract by the contract giving us the ability to transfer this fund to any foreign partner or partner till we get the necessary approvals from the relevant ministries and the relevant ministries of banking and finance.
 the money deposited with the ministry of banking and finance will be for us.
 i am contacting you through your private email address so that you can contact me through your private e-mail for more details.
 yours faithfully


i am seeking for a foreign partner to assist me in using this fund to invest in your country
in a profitable and reliable business venture.
 i am currently seeking for a foreign partner that is capable and capable of handling this kind of business
 which is capable of handling this kind of money
 you should be very pleased
 as your country is a highly stable country where all sorts of issues can be resolved.

 i shall be ready to provide you with more details on how to handle the transaction through my private e-mail address and if you are willing to work with me
 please reply me on my private e-mail address

myself and my colleagues
 i have been for 14 years a business woman
 and i am able to conceive
 and to get an inherited fortune
which i inherited through a partnership with my late husband who died in a plane crash on 7th may 2000
 in which he was one of the passengers. my late husband was a very reliable person
 and he was able to transfer all his money to a safe country where he is currently in a hospital. he was convinced that the country will not let anybody
anybody. the united states is seeking to charge him as an american citizen for his part in this money transfer.
 ""looking forward to hearing from you urgently!""

i am writing this letter with a strong desire to share my desire to invest with you. i am contacting you because i am interested in investing with you.the money deposited with the ministry of banking and finance will be for us
 for now because we cannot release the money to any foreign account because the money has been deposited in the bank. i am interested in a foreign partner
 who can handle this money and also get money into your account as an american citizen
for sharing. i propose to you that you should contact me and my colleagues through your private e-mail address so that we can discuss about how to handle this transaction through our private email address for more details.
 i am seeking your assistance to invest with you in a viable business venture which is profitable and reliable due to the fact that you are the only person who could handle this fund and also get it into your account as an american citizen for sharing.i have a lot of troubles with my bank. i have to contact my colleagues and i want them to come over to my country as soon as possible so that i can discuss about this transaction. i am afraid that this will be a huge disaster for me since we are not allowed to know the actual purpose of the money as they are not allowed to know the account and also they are not allowed to know the account if it is not called before we can transfer it to another account. i have been told that my colleague will not let me into his country because he cannot get a foreign partner to handle this because of the fact that we are not allowed to know the account if it is not called before we can transfer it to another account. i have been told by my colleague that i cannot come over here because of the fact that i cannot come over here because of my husband hard work. i have also been told that the death of my husband i"

i have an urgent and very confidential business proposal that will make it through your diplomatic and investment department to the bank.

 i am the present foreign secretary to the late mr. edward fong.
 i am saddled with the responsibility of managing our oil and mining society in a country that is a very rich and very corrupt and i have to deal with a very important banking law which applies to all foreign account holders
 and i want you to take this into account and get your account into the hands of the very rich and very corrupt people here.
 based on this i have decided to make this proposal to you.
 i am going to take a look at your account and my proposal will be to transfer the sum of us$25
000.00 (twenty five million six hundred thousand u.s.dollars) into your account with a security and finance committee.
 i have made this proposal to you because i am concerned about the safety and security of the account and my family and friends are concerned about the security of the account.
 i am also concerned about the safety of the account as all money transferred to the account through transfer of a security remit to the account will be transferred to your account as unclaimed deposits.
 i have decided that you are to be my personal accountant to handle all the deposits and the balance will be remitted to your account as unclaimed deposits. i have also decided that you will be compensated with 30% of the total money as unclaimed money and 10% as interest.
 i have also decided to give you a percentage of 30% of the total money as unclaimed money and 5% as interest on the percentage you will receive. 
 i have much to offer you and i am sure that you will not disappoint me. if you are interested in this transaction i would be glad to furnish you with more information. i am afraid that the money will be for a very selfish purpose.
 
 i have decided to send you my personal and confidential letter to you
 the way to be planned is to send to you a copy of my letter to you with a sealed box of funds. i will then give it to you as a security deposit. i will also give you a secret telephone number for easy communication.
 the letter must be accompanied by a letter of introduction and your private telephone and fax numbers for easy communication.
 as a matter of urgency
 i need your assistance to transfer the sum of us$25
000.00 (twenty five million six hundred thousand u.s.dollars) into your account as unclaimed deposits.
 the funds and the security deposit in your account are for you and my family and friends. if you are not interested

 dear beloved
     here is the hard way
 when we entered the country 
 we had some documents of a deposit of $ 28
500.000 usd (twenty eight million five hundred thousand usd ) made by my late father in a security and trust company.according to my father
 he intended to use this fund for his international business transaction after his tenure in office but was unfortunately murdered.
 we had located the security company where the money is deposited with the help of an attorney and established ownership.please right now
with the bitter experiences we had in our country and the war still going on especially in diamond area which incidentally is where we hail from .coupled with the incessant political upheavals and hostilities in this country  ivor"

she worked for a foreign bank but after the war was over
she was given a lucrative offer that she did not want. after considering all the options
the client has
the following conclusion.
 the money is for the foreign investor to purchase a home and for the foreign investor to cover the legal fees.
 the money is of no criminal origin and the money is of no risky origin. i await your response.

this transaction would be effected through various means including purchase of the shares in the company through the security firm and sale of the shares to investors in a security company with a proven track record of over investment.
 this transaction would be effected through various means including transfer of the fund into a security account or into a profitable investment vehicle.

this transaction would be effected through various means including distribution of the security fund to a suitable beneficiary or a security company that will benefit from the security transaction.
 this transaction would be executed under the leadership of the security company official with direct involvement of the security company officials.
 although this transaction is complicated by the fact that the security company officials are still alive and well and the transaction is being run by my committee
 i believe this transaction can be effected only if the officials in charge of the security company are brought to account and executed with absolute secrecy and absolute accountability by the senate and house of representatives. this is the only way this transaction will be effected.
 i am offering you a lucrative business opportunity that will make you a fortune for yourself and for your committee
 if you do not think this transaction a good one. 
 the only thing preventing this transaction from coming to an end is the fact that the security company officials were killed. 
 i am offering you a lucrative business opportunity that will make you a fortune for yourself and for your committee
 but only if you act now and bear with me until the end. 
 most importantly it is me that is offering you the lucrative opportunity to succeed
 the nigerian people. 
 to succeed i must give back to the country by investing it in the right way
 profitablely. 
 this is my proposal
 and i will be transferring all profits from this fund to your account in your country
 in order to pay for your committee
 activities.

 in the past few days i have issued to me a new and very confidential order from the attorney general of ireland. this order is perfunctory in nature as the attorney general does not reply to my mail or reply to all my reply to my email.
 ""mr. michael sullivan""
 the attorney general of ireland
 has written me to notify him that i am going to open a new account and invest in his country. my question is
 as i have already declared the fund for investment in his favour. i therefore want your assurance that this will be of acceptable quality and safety to you.
 the information contained in the confidential letter to mr. michael sullivan
 you sent to me in which i have written to you
 is untrue. i have known mr. sullivan for a very long time and he was one of our good friends in ireland
 and the man who introduced us to each other. i have known him since before the war
 which i was involved in
 which he was involved in was over-invoiced by the irish government. i have known him since before his death
 and i trust that you will not betray my trust in you. my only condition of trustworthiness is that i am capable of handling this job well
 as i am the only son of the late mr. robert sullivan
 the great irish leader of the irish liberation army
 who perished on the 9th of august
 (merry christmas). i am sure that you will agree that this matter of the amount of money
 which mr. sullivan introduced into our bank was the result of an affair that took place some time ago
 and that unfortunately led to his death
 and i am afraid that this money will never be back in this country. i am contacting you because i am sure that you will be a good partner and person to work with. furthermore
 we do not have any other child that will be like you and that will be very important to manage through hard work and hard work by both of us. whoever this person is has in mind this thing of
 investing in your country
 will be regretting it so much. it will be a pleasure to invest in your country
 and i am sure that you will be very much interested. please reply to my email for more details.

 i am the only surviving of the late mr. robert sullivan
 who was a british merchant and director of finance in the republic of ireland. he died along with his wife and two small children in the plane crash that killed him on january 31
 1993. i inherited the wealth of an immense amount of money deposited in a foreign account the late mr. robert was on before his death. i have decided to put all of the money in a safe deposit fund of united states dollars only.
 i have made several inquiries to the foreign account and have gotten no response from the bank.
 i have decided to transfer all the money deposited in the account to a foreign one according to my instructions. this would be a very lucrative business. i have asked the foreign account owner for permission to open the account for me and the proceeds. my colleagues and i have all been told that mr. edward gabel will be with us when we open the account for the transfer of this money to the account. we are confident that the offer of 10% of the total sum will be intact after the transfer. we need your kind assistance to enable us stand out in the world.
 we have a lot of bad news to deal with and we need your kind co-operation to handle it well. please reply immediately to my email if you have any further information regarding this or any other issue you are interested in.

 the cause of death is still under investigation
 but his family believe that this was a terrorist act.
 british man james williams was standing by his stevens
 who was sitting on the bed next to him when he was shot.
 before the incident
 james decided to go out to buy a new gun
 and while he was at the gun
 he realised that there was more to life than buying a new gun.
 he decided to go to the beach and seek for help of someone who can help him to get a new gun.
 the beach was his first beach home and he found out that the owner of the gun is a terrorist. he called the police and they arrested the owner of the gun but he died along with his family.
 the reason why the security company have not called the police is that the owner of the gun has an international business account in switzerland
 and they cannot issue a private letter of claim to the account because the account holder is the owner of a foreign bank account.
 according to the financial times
 the security company has not proved that the owner of the account can issue a letter of claim to the account because the account holder is a foreigner
 and the security company is still not sure if the account will be re-opened if the money is again transfered into
 the account.

 i am writing as a co-operation between two distinguished colleagues. the former of whom was an accountant at the petroleum company of south africa
 and the latter of whom is a political novice
 succeeded to the petroleum company as the president of south africa as the president of south africa. i have known mr. robert mugabe for several years now and have always been interested in working with him again. i have been very surprised and disappointed by his refusal to sign the non-esteem mining agreement with the south african government which is known to each miner.
 i am contacting you on account of the fact that i am a miner and i have the money for my company which is based here in johannesburg.
 i am contacting you because i also believe that mr. robert mugabe is a tyrant
 and that if elected president he will do everything in his power to undermine the country to make him a tyrant.
 i am the only miner here in johannesburg with the share in the money and am able to deposit this money in a bank here. the money will be for me and my late wife 
 whose late husband was a miner here. i will send you the details of the money for your assistance.
 it is my sincere wish that you would contact me and advise in your acceptance of this offer of friendship and business investment.
 i need your full co-operation in this regard as i am very interested in buying a company in the lucrative diamond and gold mining sector in south africa.
 as soon as you receive this letter i will give you the contact address and the telephone number for immediate and urgent response.

the war broke out over the release of the 3rd of august para and the subsequent release of the sum in the treasury.
the war was declared over when the army and the reserve security forces (rsf) of south africa (south africa) secured about $20.2 million of the unclaimed fund.
this fund has since been in the bank for over six years.
in my department we have a dormant fund of $50
000
000
 (military)
 which we have been banking on account of my former partner.
 since he was moved by the war to the region in the early 1990s
 he has been keeping watch over our country
 expecting us to come over to his country and claim the fund.
 unfortunately
 as he has a very old and handicapped wife and
 they did not like each other
 they kept on fighting each other and got into a very bad scuffle that lasted for more than an hour before both people were taken out of the fighting.
 now
 i am convinced that he will be okay
 with me and my partner leaving behind a huge percentage of the fund of $50
000
000 (military) for us to share in mutual benefit.
 the only problem is that i have no way of knowing when he will be okay or if he will come over to my country to claim the fund.
 unfortunately for me and my partner
 he has been taking pains to disguise his situation and has always maintained a low profile.
 now that i have gotten permission from the south african government
 we can move the fund there on a business partnership with him.
 i have a couple of options
 i can go into administration in my country or i can give up and go into politics.
 i have decided to become a political party supporter
 and stand as a political prisoner
 after the war veterans who died in the bus crash of world war ii.
  my decision to make political party supporter is because i believe the country deserves a president who will protect our country from foreign money despoiled by the war veterans.
 he has done such a thing as a former soldier and he deserves a country of his own.
 though i have no confidence in him
 i stand as a political leader to protect the interests of the country.
 it is my hope that this letter is of assistance to you
 if you are willing to give it a second thought.
 because i am afraid that if i did not give this priority over this transaction that i will lose my seat in the next government
 i would be overthrown as leader of my party
 and my followers would seek to take over the country.
 i will not fail to meet your urgent and urgent proposal for helping to save the country from foreign money.
 i am ready to give you the contact details of the bank that is assisting us in the transfer of this money and to give you more assurance that this money will be safe if returned to you.
 be assured that this money will be 100% legal under south africa law.
 yours sincerely.
 mrs.f.k. kindara.

this letter may concern you
 but we are really interested in your kind self.
 this is an urgent matter because we have a son who died in the armed struggle in our country and we are worried that if he does not come out as a christian and rebel leader we could be overthrown out of power.
 with the help of my two sons business venture firm madera capital established a fund in your country to invest in our top valued firms. now we are looking forward to investing in your company when he or she is safe and sound.
 the money will be for my two sons and will be for my share in the fund until they are old enough to invest.

 please reply immediately. i look forward to hearing from you immediately.

the fund was originally gotten for christmas present by my brother-in-law.
 my brother-in-law has been in and out of the military for over 15yrs now he is fighting in arms with the rebels in hanoi

 he is a self proclaimed ""democratic socialist"" and a founding member of the viet cong terror group.

 owing to the present problem that i have
 we cannot have any son or daughter in the near future.
 i have decided to donate this fund to an individual or company that will be able to provide security for their headquarters and for all the employees that are presently being treated badly in the hanoi criminal justice system.
 this is an excellent opportunity that i have had in my power to give back to the country and especially the country as a whole.
 i have already given away several millions of dollars in total to security companies and individuals that are based in this country.
 security companies and individuals that are based in this country
 as well as to provide technical support to military and security companies that are operating in the country.

 my fathers name is major general ahmed akpundu a rebel commander of the iraqi national army (snha) from the northern region of nineveh province. he lost his life on the way to the hospital from his position along the iraq-africa border in a battle with the rebels. i am writing now because i am mourning the death of my father in such a way because of the desperation i felt prior to his death. i have decided on the most immediate and most profitable of all means of getting to the rebel leaders and fighting them to death because of my insecurity. i am not sure if this would be worth the trouble because i am not the type to handle risky situations this way but because of the urgency of the matter. i am contacting you because i am sick of hearing from you and am watching closely for a reliable person who will help me pass this fund over to you.
 i have a very good and very reliable confidant in my family that is also a rebel leader. he is a trustworthy man and a very good man who will never betray his country to any foreigner. he made a very good investment in you and is currently in hospital with a minor heart attack. i am afraid that if this proposal does not work out i will go into exile in any part of the world where i will be most vulnerable. i decided to make this proposal because i am quite sure that you will be very kind and kind to me
 and will never betray me.
 this transaction is done under a legitimate arrangement that guarantees the smooth transfer of the funds to you as my relative. i am sure that by helping you achieve your potential
 you will be rewarded accordingly. please do not hold back in your response because i am sure that you will not disappoint us here.
 i need your assistance to make this happen. i am a rebel soldier and a good man. as such i have been fighting for the country my fathers led his country into under the false pretext of helping the poor. i have been fighting alongside the rebel forces for over four decades now and i still stand a huge amount of trust in you. i have the courage to ask you one of these important questions:
 1. is your family members alive now and are they still alive?
 2. is there money left over from your unsuccessful coup plot?
 3. is there any other viable alternative?
 4. is there any safe country or safe city you would like to leave for a safe country?
 5. is there any other way forward that will save my life than to contact me through my private e-mail address?
 reply to this and other resources you may provide.

 dear sir/madam
 i am mikhail khodorkovsky
 the director of procurement and contract award at the ministry of finance
 of russia and a member of the international monetary fund (imf) staff. since 1999
 i have been the director of procurement and contract award at the ministry of finance in
 the russian federation. i have held this post since 1998 and was the deputy director of procurement and contract award for a period of
 four years. since the retirement of the late mr. sberbank
 who was poisoned by his political followers to death by a very wealthy jewish businessman in
 the city of kraków
 in the southern part of poland
 i have made several attempts to reach mr. sberbank through the embassies and consulates and the
 latter refused to let me in due to the pending transfer of the funds to the bank account of the
 former bank and trust company (b.t.). i have not gotten any reply from his bank since
 i am the only surviving son from the late mr.sebastian and my only wish is that he might come over to his aid and be better
 able to deal with me again
 if i come over again.
 i have decided to seek for other people to serve as his immediate or near family
 as my situation will not permit it. i have already deposited the amount i want in a safe deposit box in a
 european bank account and will transfer it immediately into the bank account of another
 russia
 based. i will forward to you this confidential diplomatic/business proposition i sent you to seek your assistance and assist in getting my money out of russia
 for the first time in my life. i have decided to contact you because i am interested in investing in your country and the quality of the investment is high
 i need your assistance to get this money out of russia for good.
 i have all the necessary documents that will give you an idea of the quality of the investment and the investment opportunities.
 this is a very risky investment and i have to wait and see how this deal goes down. i have said all my intentions of going into business
 only to lose it all and go into debt
 with the hope of never again having any of my money again.
 please do not let this deter you from making the right investment in your country as i am sure you will be very much interested in the transaction.
 sincerely yours

bangkok (reuters) - thai security forces on saturday arrested a top official in the former communist republic of the former ruler of andhra pradesh and charged him with embezzlement of state funds.

the arrest comes three days after a huge uprising overthrew president prayuth chan-ocha from power.
the uprising was sparked by the political and economic   dissent that had been building in andhra pradesh for more than two decades.
madhu prasad raja, the former ruler of andhra pradesh and presently the chief executive of madras, was arrested early on saturday morning and later died.
he was a founding member of the orphanage for orphans in andhra pradesh.
he was a devoted husband and father to both of their children.
he was assassinated by the orphanages security forces after the uprising.
he was a founding member of the orphanages in andhra pradesh and presently the orphanages director.
he was a dear friend and trusted confidant of our prime minister prayuth chan-ochaar
who was recently arrested in andhra pradesh by the orphanages security forces for allegedly embezzlement of funds.
he was been held for ransom by the orphanages security forces for allegedly being a rebel leader in andhra.
he was eventually murdered by the orphanages security forces after the uprising.
he was a founding member of the orphanages in andhra pradesh and presently the orphanages director.
he was also murdered by the orphanages security forces after the uprising.
he was a founding member of the orphanages in andhra pradesh and presently the orphanages chief inspector.
he was a devoted mother and grandmother to his late husband.

she was later murdered by the orphanages security forces after the uprising.
her body was later discovered by the orphanages security forces after the uprising.
her body was later discovered by the security forces and handed over to us for possible safekeeping.

 as a citizen of the republic of south africa i have a very important and lucrative business proposition for you. on the commencement of my diplomatic relations with south africa i was granted asylum in the republic of south africa by the regime of former president robert mugabe. i was not aware of any other asylum seeker on this continent that could claim this sum of $500 million dollars (us$500 million) which i had been granted. i was expecting to receive this money in the bank of a reputable investment bank in johannesburg but my present position as a finance major in south africa made this impossible for me. upon my arrival to the republic of south africa in late august of last year i lodged a formal claim with the bank with the money in the custody of one of my junior colleagues and we have been married for the past twelve months. as a result of my unsuccessful effort to claim the money as my own on my present position as a finance major in south africa and a foreigner in the bank of a reputable investment bank in johannesburg
 i am now proposing to you to take the following action to secure the funds as your own and transfer to your account as the beneficiary.
 accumulate the money into your account as a company business and once the money has been remitted to your account for investment purposes
 as soon as you receive the money into your bank account.
 i have the honour of sending you a copy of this proposal and assurance that the money will be intact and intact for investment purposes. you must have confidence that i am capable of handling this transaction under favourable arrangements. i have the honour of inviting you to come to my capital city johannesburg for a private business discussion and i shall be inviting you to come as a partner in the bank as i hope to have you be part of the successful transfer of this huge sum of money.
 the percentage will be the seventeen for beneficiary
 twenty-five percent will be for me as compensation for my labor and the remaining 10 percent will be for expenses i have incurred as a refugee. this proposal is simple and simple. i shall give you the code of ethics for this transaction as i am willing to accept the offers of sharing this money with you and that is why i am contacting you. i will give you four months to respond to me informing you of the decision to come to my bank account and the amount. i have the right to do this as i am a foreigner in south africa and i am required to take over the fund if i do not want the money declared safe in the bank by the south african government. please kindly guide and assist me in getting this fund approved as this will be my last.
 i want to raise money through a legitimate business relationship between two of my customers and the proceeds will be deposited in the bank for investment. i am also interested in building a business with you and i am banking with your firm.
 before we move
 i would like to introduce myself to you as a foreigner. i am mr. richard samson. i am the manager of financial services at client bank samson asset management ltd in london. i am the second person to come up as an interest target with the client bank but this time i was not prepared for all the situations that may arise from the fact that i am the only one in the bank with the information that could have given you the key to the million dollar deposit. i have therefore decided to 
 contact you on this account to invest in your country as my country is very wealthy in the west and i am not going to let my country down by allowing my client to rob me. i am not a rich man and i am willing to give any sum as long as it is good management and good customer service. if you are interested
 please reply immediately. i will give you the contact details of the bank but i want you to be aware that as an investor here in london
 you are more than likely to invest in your country. i am not afraid to do anything to get the money as it is my country that you are about to embark on this great business venture. however
 thing is
 i am not rich and i dont live near a rich person and this is my main purpose of contacting you.i am seeking to derive a good living through my business and this is the only way i can do this through as much effort and effort as possible. i am seeking to invest in your country in a good percentage which i believe is 70% for me and 35% for you. i am proposing to you as a foreigner receive a good percentage of the total money for yourself and me.this would be negotiable by the treasury so you must provide me with the full names of the bank officials that are with whom you are seeking to invest and the actual amount involved. if you are willing to help
 i will give you 10% of the total money for you and 5% for me in the transaction. i will give you 5% of the money for every dollar yo"

 my name is president of my dear childrens university
 tunisia. i am the only son of late dr. ahmed al-sisi
 a former linguist on the staff of the foreign correspondents office in london. i have been with the staff for twelve years and have been their chief linguist since the start of the civil war in my country. on the 11th of october 2000 he was killed in an air strike by the rebels on his house that lasted for twelve (12) hours. i have been with him since the beginning and i have known his family for over 35 years. in my office we have the following information: my husband is a muslim
 my father was a muslim and my mother a christian
 in my late husband was a huge supporter of the ousted president mohamed moseed mussah
 and his family. in fact he is said to have asked my late husband to give up his seat in the cabinet and go into politics and seek political office in tunisia. my husband was in hospital for a heart attack and he died on the 18th of october 2000. i have known my late husband for 35 years and have known him to be a very good and dedicated man
 he was always positive and always interested in helping people. i am sure that if his health remained or deteriorated further he would have known the help he was looking for in leaving politics. i have known him through my late husband for 35 years
 i have known him for 20 years now but only because i was with him when he was poisoned and brutally beaten by his rebel followers. my late husband was a very good and dedicated man
 he always made me feel good and wanted to be with me. i am sure that if he has the will and will to do what i have asked him to do to help me retain my husband
 i will stand by him and do any thing to help him. i have known him since the beginning and i am afraid of death if i do not act now. i will not let my future husbands life be in danger as my husband was very kind to me. i want you to be very aware of the dangers in your situation and to be prepared for anything that may come to happen as soon as you get along well. please do not entertain any concern as i will be contacting you if any one comes up as a possible source of information for you. i strongly believe that all christians should be prayerful and do not be greedy in believing that god will be merciful to all people.
 this letter is written to bring to your notice that i am contacting you on this matter of a serious and very personal nature. i am hitchhiking to visit my sick late husband in hospital with serious medical condition. before our arrival we sat down and decided to meet face to face. i will call him and introduce ourselves to the other passengers on the bus and i will offer him a good negotiable sum of us$30
000
000.00 (seven million five hundred thousand us dollars) as a present for the trip. we will be leaving immediately for tunisia.
 i will be contacting you through my private email account for immediate distribution of the money we are hitch-free in. i have instructed the bank to issue you a new banking account and this time we will be going through your private e-mail.
 i have secured the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the release of this money. this money will be given back to me if i am successful in getting it deposited with your private account. please observe utmost confidentiality and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us. looking forward to hear from you soon.

afrique resident mohammed abacha was arrested on friday by iraqi security forces and has been under house arrest for the past four days.
""we have been in contact with the security forces indicating that abacha is a serious threat to the security of the country and the security of the future of our country. my name is mohammed abacha and i am the only surviving son of the late former iraqi president saddam hussein who was overthrown from power by american-led forces in 2003.
""we are both very afraid of the americans and very worried that they might come for us. since i was a very poor person and only made a few hundred dollars ($329.5 million pounds) in this country during the war to liberate anbar province from the iraqi government and the british-administered oil company i have been watching very closely to see if any of my father's companies will go into disrepair and of no use to me because i am the only surviving son of the late president saddam.
""i have been watching closely to see that his company will be rendered unserviceable by the government because of the insecurity and insecurity of the people of anbar province. i am confident that the government will make a positive investment in my father's company because of this financial assistance he gave to the americans but i am afraid that the government is secretly watching over my every step and will kill me if i do not do something about it immediately if the money is not returned to the government immediately,"" abacha told a local media.
""the security forces have confiscated my documents and my passport as my only document of origin. i have called my local bank and the security company but they have refused to re-service my money because they regard me as a terrorist and never will be. it is because of this i am afraid that i will be targeted by security forces again,"" he added.

 nddc are currently in need of a foreign partner with whose bank account we shall transfer the sum of forty nine million
 five hundred thousand united states dollars($49.5m).this fund was accrued from various over invoicing of contracts awarded to foreign contractors over the existing years of this commission. 
 however
 by virtue of our position as civil servants and members of the nddc
 we cannot acquire this funds in our name. this is because as top civil servants
 we are not allowed by law of the land to own or operate bank accounts outside our country for now therefore
 i have been delegated as a matter of trust by my colleagues
to look for an oversea trusted partner in whose account we would transfer the fund hence the reason for this mail. 
 note please: we shall be transferring the fund to your account with your company as the beneficiary and you are been paid for a contract
which you executed for our country through the nddc.  for your support and partnership

i am a former contractor with the information security agency of the nigerian government. i have been assigned to locate and prosecute an illegal money transfer
 business with a bank of nigeria and i have been unsuccessful.
 upon receiving payment from the account holder and the beneficiary
 i immediately contacted you and arranged to meet on my behalf to discuss about the transaction. i have been informed that the account holder is an american based
 and i am not a citizen of nigeria. i have been instructed to transfer the money into a foreign account with my private telephone and fax number and telephone and fax number must be used to reach you. i am therefore contacting you to assist in locating and/or prosecute this business out of nigeria.
 i am interested in investing in a highly secured and profitable business that will derive valuable foreign exchange value. we shall discuss the details
 and the percentage
 of the fund which will be invested in our country. i have agreed to give you 20% of the total sum for your assistance.
 i want to know your private telephone and fax number for easy communication and also your private phone and fax number for extended communication.

the federal government of nigeria
 have decided to give us the same percentage of the proceeds of this fund as an orphanage
 which we have been expecting for a long time now.
   this request was made to you by the late mr.james tepper
 who was the director of  security and patent office in nigeria.
   mr. james tepper
 a highly reputable and highly accomplished attorney. he was well known for his efforts on behalf of the united nations development program and with the assistance of the federal government of nigeria
 he and his family were able to transfer over 40% of the deposited fund into a foreign account while the remaining 70% was inherited by his late father.
   the proceeds of this account are for the benefit of all the children of mr. james tepper who died from a plane crash.
   this is one of the saddest    stories of my life.  my late father had several accounts with various financial institutions including bank of nigeria.   after his death
 the account was transferred into the custody of the federal government of nigeria.   i took this proposal to you because we have no other viable source of capital.
   in the course of this transfer
   all the beneficiary
   other personal      personal bank accounts were opened
 and after transferring this money into our bank
   we got a receipt from the bank indicating that this money is for the benefit of all the children of mr. james tepper
   and his late father.
   the account is in a trust company and i have been instructed to contact you to assist in drafting and drafting the necessary    contracts in the bank to secure this money pending arrival in your account.
   the account is under security company and i have been instructed to direct the assistance of a security company for the transfer of this money into your account.
   the arrangement is that the fund will be invested in a multi-national company
   which will provide for the transfer of this fund into your account.
   this transaction will take about 5 working days
   and should be concluded within 5 working days.
   the security company is a successful and reliable company which will provide us with the necessary materials and the necessary    documents to prepare the approved transfer contract for the anticipated release of this fund into your account.
   the funds will be worked out in a routine transaction which will take about 5 working days.
   please keep this in mind as i will be contacting you to advise on how to transfer this fund out of the country into your account.
   please do not delay or make any difficult decision as there is no risk.
   my trust and confidence in you is going to be tested and i will be expecting your response to this mail.
   i am contacting you because i have been informed that the funds of this account will be released into your account as a result of this transaction . please keep this in mind as i will be contacting you through this medium.

according to the court filing, the federal government of malaysia paid the court with a view to investing in a future major international power like china.
""the government believes that by investing in this future country we will be exporting our soul to a foreign land where we will serve as the domiciles for the foreseeable future. this will involve a fee of five million us dollars an hour ($5.5m).
""the government believes that by transferring this money to a foreign country i will be able to invest this money into a profitable business that i am dreaming of investing here in this country.""
according to the court filing, the federal government of malaysia plans to invest the money into a few profitable projects in this country before moving on to the following projects.
""to enable me to invest this money into a profitable business that i am considering investing here in this country.""

the documents also state that the money will be used for the construction of a residential complex on site which the federal government of canada is leasing for a total of us$9million us a pop.
 the federal government of canada is also transferring the money to a trust which will be run by a foreign person.
according to the documents, the federal government is also considering moving the money into a savings account in your country as this will be used for future investment here into this country.
 however, as i said earlier that evening in my media blackout, i still have not come up with a good sound financial means to transfer this money into my country.
 so i came up with the most logical and lucrative financial means to transfer the money into my country.
 the proposal was immediately picked up by my international colleagues and colleagues as well as by my colleagues in the media.
 so here we are as colleagues and colleagues as we are lucky.
 could this be the end of this bitter media dispute?
 or was this a chance for us to get together and work out a better way forward than the above mentioned method?
 could this be the beginning of something huge for us as colleagues and colleagues here in indonesia too?
 could this be the beginning of our plans as co-workers here in canada too?
 could this be the beginning of our plans in india too?
 could this be the beginning of our plans in canada too?
 could this be the beginning of our plans in america too?
 could this be the beginning of our plans in canada too?
 could this be the beginning of our plans in europe too?
 could this be the beginning of our plans in africa too?
 could this be the beginning of our plans in asia too?
 could this be the beginning of our plans in europe too?
 could this be the beginning of our plans in the middle east too?
 could this be the beginning of our plans in the west too?
 could this be the beginning of our plans in the asia-pacific region too?
 could this be the beginning of our plans in the south as we have so many plans in our to-do list?
 could this be the beginning of our other projects as we have so many more in our file for when we open our bank accounts.
 we hope you will help us in these areas as we have so much to offer you as we make our international reach a reality.
 thank you for your co-operation.

former president of the democratic republic of congo

 i am sorry for the delay in my reply and my desire to hear from you is that you can help us get this money out of here as soon as possible
 but we are not all that interested in this matter.
 we have both been very busy and have not worked out everything we should have done together.
 we are both married but have had a very bad relationship.

 my father was the president of south africa for the last time since the death of his wife.
 he died along with his four children on the 18th of june 1990
 after which he left for lusaka where he died alone.
 the reason why i am asking for your help is that i am a woman
 and i am a woman of great virtue.
 i am also in the position of a woman

 to help me and my husband
my intention is that i will not want to have any other child

 this is a member of the public who was with a foreign partner in manila. he was also with the russian embassy there. he was present during the air strikes on the rebel-held areas of the country as they lay very vulnerable. on arrival in manila
  he informed me that the government was about to declare the rich deposits with the balance due in the name of the mothers of the deceased in the name of national interest.
 he then made the deposit and made a claim for one-half of the balance. i am not sure if this was a wise move or not. the money was deposited by an officer of the philippines airforce base in kalabaoq province. he took this discovery with him to his residence where he deposited the money. i do not know what the purpose of this claim was but i do want to know the reason behind the deposit and the amount due in the name of the mothers. i have decided to trust you with this information because if you are interested
 we can work it out for us. all legal documents concerning the deposit must be worked out with the relevant ministries and the fedex.
 i am afraid that this transaction would go badly if discovered out. i am contacting you to assist in the transfer of this fund to you. i am willing to give you a good negotiable percentage for your assistance. if you are interested
 please reply immediately via this email. i will be more than willing to assist you. i am not the type to give out too many details and i will give you everything i know about you. please indicate to me your email address <a shape=""rect"" href=""mailto:danis_kazuki@yahoo.com"">danis_kazuki@yahoo.com</a>

 i am convinced that the most effective political solution to this crisis will be the political establishment and the military establishment of iraq that has all the political and military assistance and political support to take this crisis to an extreme.
i have been seeking for a political solution to this crisis since the establishment of the new government led by president saddam hussein to the death of my father

 i am writing to request your assistance and assistance in locating a reliable and reliable foreign partner for a business venture in your country.i am in the position of providing the necessary and necessary legal and financial documents for a legitimate business venture.the only thing that bothers me most is that my company is in a state of disarray and the legal process in this regard is still on. i am urgently seeking your honest cooperation to facilitate the transfer of this fund to you.
 i have some ideas for you
but you cannot help me because my claim to the fund is still on the back of a late husband and his family.
 i want him and his family to know that this money belongs to the late husband and all the security measures that he undertook to keep this money for themselves was the only thing that kept this money from going into the hands of the rebels. all other means of transfer to you is up for negotiation
but unfortunately the rebels are still alive and they are still trying to get my husband and his family to come over to syria to fight for a better future for themselves and their family.

lagos-nigeria
 dear friend

 i am mr.roland ariza from nigeria
 an accountant and partner in an investment bank
 and i have a very confidential and very confidential business proposition for you.
 before the start of the first tranche of the nigerian new bonds (nnb)
 i made a numbered time (fixed) deposit valued us$25
000
000.00 (eleven million five hundred thousand united states) with an officer from a large
 foreign bank.
 after the deposit was confirmed by my bank
 i sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but was unsuccessful.
 before the pending notification
 i went to his name and confirmed that the deposit was indeed confirmed by my bank.
 the officer told me that my present position as the director of finance and accounting
 meant that i could not be contacted to make the deposit as he was not a partner in the bank
 so i sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but was unsuccessful.

so
 i made further investigation and discovered that the officer
 who informed me of the deposit
 was my former boss and now a close confidant of president charles taylor
 whom i have since worked with.
 i am confident that you will be very much interested in this transaction. i will be willing to give you a good negotiable percentage for your assistance in view of having already made the deposit with the officer in question.
 be assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because i shall need your assistance to invest the money in your country.
 best regards

 i am contacting you with this proposal because i am interested in investing in your country.
 
  i am a diplomat and i am a good friend of sir john major who is the second consignment to be discovered in the last war in iraq.
 
  the funds were deposited in a foreign bank account in iraq and i was the only one to find out that the money was for food and medicine. 
   in my job as the finance minister of iraq i deposited a huge sum of money and deposited it in a foreign bank account. 
 
  this has scared the hand of the bank to release the money to the people of iraq and they have been doing this for the last several years. 
  i am contacting you as a foreigner because i am not allowed to act as the trustee of the money and the money was deposited in the account of a foreign partner.
 
  meanwhile the government is claiming the money as a foreign fund and not my business. since the war the government has been trying to claim all the proceeds of the war dead as civilian victims. this is because the war dead were either dismembered
 or left unclaimed in the war crime chambers. 
  if the money remained unclaimed after 9/11
 the money will be confiscated by the government as civilian victims. 
  my position as finance minister guarantees the safety of the fund and the safety of the country. i will not forget the fund or reveal the fund to anyone. if you are interested
 please reply immediately to my email address. 
 i strongly believe that the successful transfer of a huge sum of money through a foreign account to my country as a viable partner is the most secure and secure investment i will make in the world. 
 i want you to be very considerate and considerate and not do this to anyone. 
 please do not betray confidence in me or any of my colleagues or i would destroy the entire project. 
 if you are interested
 please reply immediately to my email address. 
 thank you.

 my late husband was a huge zionist who was a major supporter of the establishment of the state of israel in the us. i also discovered that my father was a major supporter of the establishment of the jewish people in power in the world. this led to a lot of problems that i have since gotten quite used to.

 i am also seeking the consent of the attorney general of your country for the release of this money into your custody safely.
 i am contacting you because the amount of money you sent me is not a very good investment because i made a very bad investment. my only hope of making a good investment is if you can give a very honest face to this money. i am willing to give you a good negotiable percentage for your effort and effort during this process. i will give you 10% of this money as compensation for your effort and effort during this process. i will give you 20% of this money as a medium of exchange for your assistance during this process. we will hope to have a child together and this will be the beginning of our relationship. the money will be for us
 we shall use this money to purchase a house in your country or to buy a new car for ourselves. i am very sure that any money you send to me will be for us both good. please do not take this opportunity to contact me again as i am in the process of moving out of the us since i am moving with my only son to another country.

 i am contacting you as a foreigner to seek your assistance after my discovery during auditing in your bank as am the manager of bill and exchange at the foriegn remittance department of bank of africa
(b.o.a.) in my department we discovered an abandoned sum of usd$10.8million us dollars in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family in plane crashes 2000

 since his death
 we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and 
 claim his money because we can not release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking and financial policies but unfortunately all the efforts proved abortive.
 it is therefore upon this discovery that i decided as the head of my 
 ""department to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we dont want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bills.""
 do not view this as been illegal but an opportunity for us to help enrich 
 our hope in life instead of the bank converting this much money to the 
 security funds.you should not nurse any atom of fear as all required 
 arrangements have been made for the smooth transfer of this funds and your acceptance is what will crown this effort.
 we will conclude this operation within 14 banking days based on the amount of coperation you will contribute.

hello
i am mrs. rebecca kabbal
 daughter of late mrs. daniel esq.i am a resident of one of the country in the west african region of west africa.
 my father died on the 23rd of may 2002 and i am still without a valid document of a valid retirement account. i have been waiting for your assistance to send the funds to you as a genuine security and foreign account and to make good arrangement for you to make the transfer from one of my fathers bank account to another in your country.
 my father was a foreign business man and his contract employers were not interested in this issue.
 as a result of my father death my father decided to withdraw the accumulated amount of $27 million dollars(fifteen million five hundred thousand dollars) from my account into a foreign account in your country.
 ""i am looking forward to your urgent reply as soon as you receive this letter from me.""
 i have the ability to provide the correct details of the account to you
 but most importantly you want to know the balance of the total amount of $27 million dollars (fifteen million five hundred thousand dollars) as well as the percentage of the total amount as a percentage of the balance of the account as the security and foreign account.
 i will furnish you with more details as indicated by the bank in a detailed and confidential paperback and to understand the details of this transfer
 you will need to apply to the bank for cooperation and also have your name and address as the beneficiary of the account.
 the account is open for the transfer of dollars in your name and that of my father as the beneficiary.
 i will set you up with the necessary documents to transfer the money to your account.
 yours sincerely

 for over a decade before he died on 20th of march in the year 2007.
 he died after a brief  illness that lasted for two weeks. before his death he made a vow to use his wealth for the down trodden and the less privileged in the society. when my brother was alive he deposited the sum of £250 million pounds (two hundred and fifty million pounds) with one united kingdom security company in london.

the funds are locked in two metallic trunk boxes
 deposited with these company

 i have decided to donate this fund to an individual or company
that will utilize this money the way i am going to instruct herein. ""
 ""i want an individual or company that will use this to fund and provide succor to poor and indigent persons
 orphanages
 and widows and for propagating peace in the universe. i understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. i took this decision because i do not have any one that will inherit this money and my staying in the refugee camp
 still dont know when ill be granted the visa permit out of iraq. i do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner
 hence the reason for taking this bold decision.""
 i do not need any telephone communication in this regard because of my uneasy access to the facility in the refugee camp here in iraq. also because of the presence of social security in the camp
 i do not want them to know. with allah all things are possible.

 zimbabwe. i am the son of former president
 the late mr. frank kabu
 who died in a plane crash on the 21st of september 2000.
 my father was awarded the rights to the seat of power in the zimbabwe national assembly by the national assembly for the acceptance of a cash payment into his account as a deposit.
 my father was a political activist
 but has since resigned from office and the party of president robert mugabe has declared war on him. the deteriorating security situation in zimbabwe
 has led my father to seek asylum in switzerland
 where he is now seeking asylum.
 i am writing this letter after a brief but successful business trip to switzerland and switzerland.
 i am presently in switzerland with my wife and three children for the purpose of investing in swiss bank accounts.
 the reason for my visit is to visit the bank and receive an investment certificate.
 it is in switzerland that i discovered that my father was declared bankrupt.
 the bank itself is a huge investment centre where i seek asylum.
 i am still in the custody of the bank and am awaiting my turn to present my application for asylum to the bank.
 my father has established a private banking and investment company here but this is no longer profitable for the bank. i have decided to seek for an alternative to seek asylum in switzerland.
 i am contacting you because of the instability in zimbabwe and because of the present crisis in my country. i have been in contact with your company for several days and i am now in switzerland and intend to apply for asylum in switzerland.
 i am in the know as a foreigner but am not aware of my family origin or the presence of my family members here because of the instability in zimbabwe.
 i am contacting you because i believe that you are the person that is most capable to handle this situation. i have arranged for you to come over to my country for the purpose of investing and to discuss the business of the company and my future.
 i have decided that you are the person that will be most capable to handle this dilemma. i have been assured that your company will be of great assistance to me.
 i have all necessary documents that will enable you to present your application to the bank for asylum.
 if you are interested in this matter
 please send me an urgent reply immediately by fax or write to me immediately.

 i am presently in distress and in need of money
 a personal representative of my
 appreciative kind. i have a client who is soliciting for a contract awarded to a contract manufacturer. the manufacturer claims that the manufacturer has not paid for the entire contract for which the money is awarded. the firm claims this as their reason for not paying.
 my client is a highly paid official of the republic of ireland and a member of the royal irish fleece team. he has been awarded several millions of dollars in contracts awarded to him by the government of ireland during the national assembly elections a decade ago this year.
 my client is a civil servant and a founding member of the irish fleece team. he therefore requests that i urgently notify him of my intentions to remain involved with the government of ireland in the areas of fdi, corruption and tough terms such as minimum wage.
 this request was firstly made to me by my former colleagues and secondly because it is my present and legitimate desire to remain as an official with the government of ireland.

 married
 two very successful
 and very happy
 businesspeople.i have been interested in buying a property in the city of acagel here in andalusia for a very good business
which i have been considering for a possible relocation.
 i have decided to seek for foreign investor a viable and capable person to invest my money in my country.
 i am very interested in making a investment in your country and am ready to offer huge investment
that will help me make a lot of money.
 i have decided to apply for a foreign investment license and the approval of the relevant foreign bank branches in your country.
 i am contacting you because of the immense investment that you are making in your country and because of my desire to make a claim on your money and assets.
 before the death of my father
 i made claims on his funds
 including his account in my fathers account
but i found out that he died in the line of duty. the money was deposited in a foreign bank vault in andalusia.
 the country where he died
was the heartland of the former british state of andraún republic and the result of a british/us agreement.
 before the death of my father
 i had deposited with the security company an amount of us$11.5 million (ten million five hundred thousand us dollars) in one account and the other account number four hundred and seventy-six million united states dollars in another account.
 the account was opened with the assistance of my father when he was a child and we have since lived in constant contact through my presence and work.
 i have declared all my assets in the account and the security company has declared my share.
 the total amount of twenty million united states dollars has not been declared to any foreign bank but my late father
 who was a very wealthy cocoa merchant
 deposited the fund in one account and the account number has been locked away for now.
 the security company have declared the funds to be safe
 and the security company have declared the security company to be my partner
 because he is a close friend of my late father. it is my hope that this transaction will be concluded within the next 24 to 48hrs because i am afraid that the security company will kill the security company off because i am a close friend and not a threat to their plans. however
 if the security company does not approve this transaction
i will prepare the necessary documents and obtain the necessary approval to proceed with the transaction.
 i want you to be advised that for the safety of the fund and the well being of all involved
 all legal and financial documents regarding this transaction has been finalized and all parties have mutually agreed to do business. you should read more about the security company here.
 with thanks and god
 bless you.

 first and foremost i want to introduce myself to you
 and introduce myself to your country.i am mr.lydia ann kaffir
 a routine check-in and verification service reputed to be a former army officer and personal aid to former president of angola guevara.since 2002
 i have been the coordinator of routine check-in and verification by the joint security committee with the ministry of international development (midd).the committee is responsible for the routine check-in and verification of foreign investment contracts in my country.during my investigation
 i discovered that mr.n. kaffir was the owner of an investment firm in angola. upon further investigation
 i learnt that mr.kaffir died alone in a luxury hotel in a state of abasement. upon further investigation and verification
 i found out that mr.kaffir was responsible for the death of my father and that i should seek for a foreign partner to take over the affairs of angola
 hence the urgent and hostile nature of this transaction.
 on investigation
 i discovered that mr.kaffir was a former personal aid to former president guevara
 and that i should seek for a foreign partner to take over the affairs of angola
 hence the urgency and hostile nature of this transaction.
 it was with this in mind that i on friday 8th of his deathbed in a hotel in a country of your choice. i called my local partner and nominated him as my next of kin for the purpose of investing in your country. he is survived by his wife and two small children.the bank officials in question did not respond to my call and instead sent me an urgent confirmation through my contact box that mr.kaffir had died without a name.i therefore sent a routine notification to their forwarding address but was unsuccessful in getting the information they sent me.
 i therefore decided to seek for a foreign partner the person who will take over the management of the fund and distribute it to you as the beneficiary according to the percentages indicated in the contract. a favorable result would be to have you meet with us to discuss the transaction.the money will be paid into the bank account of the deceased and the beneficiary will be declared the owner/widom on the next of kin verification of the funds. please reply to my address so i can give you a good reply as soon as you send me your reply.

dear friend

 i am an iraqi refugee and former business man who was once a wealthy owner of a gold and diamond merchant business in basra-west africa. i was last seen alive on 31st december 2003
 with his wife and four surviving children. i have decided to send an urgent and very confidential message to you because of the immense and deep sorrow i feel for the loss of my husband and all those i have assisted.
 i have decided to send this message because it is the only way i can sincerely hope for the successful execution of this great business and the survival of my family. i am contacting you because of the immense need and will of my people to take me into custody if this trip were to go ahead as planned.
 i am a man of vision and determination who always expects the next of kin and the next of kin only in the search for a worthy and accomplished person to handle this business with. i have been searching for someone who can stand as my next of kin for the last few years and i have not found one. i am not alone. i have heard that some wealthy americans and some jewish have also come to my country claiming to be my people. this is all very strange because i have never been able to lodge any claim as the only son of the late mr. and mrs. saddam hussein who was the personal carpenter to me. my late father and my late mother were among the millionaires who made this land claim and i am sure that nobody will ever again claim it again.
 my late father was one of these millionaires who died in the plane crash of alaska airlines. he was a very good man and dedicated man. he was also very accommodating to all the passengers and staff on board. i have known him for a very long time now and saw no reason why he should ever go on to become one of the millionaires on account of his attitude and loyalty. as soon as he was reminded of the crash he immediately called me and told me about it and i therefore made the request of his family and they consented to be his personal medical help in making this happen.
 it is my hope that this letter will be of assistance to you. i am a very good doctor and the only one who can treat all kinds of sick people. i have known him for over 30yrs now and i am sure that he will never forget this family name. i am sure that he will not give up on us and that he will never give up on us either. i am very afraid that he will betray us all to come to his aid and that he will destroy everything he made possible by you. i am waiting for your full co-operation in this very important business. i am afraid that if the government of iraq does not take immediate action against saddam hussein or any of his officials that he will destroy everything in his power to do with regard to this huge investment of us$14.5 million in his company
 that he made with his country in the arms industry
 i will destroy everything in my power to do with regard to this huge investment.
 please reply immediately via my private email address. i will give you a good negotiable percentage for your effort and your assistance to enable us share in the future of this fund.
 thanks and regards

   1) to purchase a new plane seat for the new generation of south african farmers who are dying on the spot
 2) to purchase the new machinery and chemicals to manufacture the new machinery and chemicals for the new farmers to produce their own foodstamp (white rice) and the new machinery and chemicals to manufacture the new machinery and chemicals for the new farmers
 3) to invest the money
 which will be invested in the future only into a viable business venture.
   i am confident that this letter will be of much interest to you.   i am seeking your share and confidence in your willingness to stand as the beneficiary of this money to your country.   i have confidence that this will be of immediate benefit to you and that you will not let me down.
   i wish to provide you with the bank account number
 which you will need to open a new account with the south africa bank.
    please reply to this letter only through my private email address
   because i will not know the reason you are contacting me.   i will only ask you to treat this business with as much respect and confidentiality as possible.

 i have decided to move this fund out of south africa to your country as a beneficiary.

 my late husband was one of the leaders of the non-aligned hard line rebel movement that overthrew the corrupt government of president charles taylor

 this is my proposal to you because i am afraid that if i keep my word i will be overthrown out of office and nobody will be around to save me.

 i have decided to give you the percentage of the total deposit amount

kabba wine
 
she bought a box of kabob for us
we got the box and went into the house to buy
 the wine
the money from the box.
 when we got into the box we saw that the money is for a college admission certificate
 we said to ourselves ""this is a great idea and i will do my part and give it to you if you will give me your full
 bank information (your full social security number) to enable me transfer this money into your account immediately after the christmas and new year celebration"".
 so we put the money into a safe box and locked the money in a safe box.
 when we got home from the christmas and new year celebration that was so so so great to us and we did not know what was inside
 we took the money and ran into the bush to survive.
 when we got to the bush we found that there was a huge tree with a branch that led down to the bush.
 we ran into the bush to retrieve the money
 but fortunately nobody was present and was able to help us.
 we got the money out of the safe box and deposited it with a security company that is based in pretoria.
 i want you to transfer this money into your account immediately after christmas and new year celebration
 so that you can invest this money into a profitable business that you will wish you could never have known about.
 i want you to give me your full social security number so that i can give you the full banking details of all the money you paid for this business with.
 i want you to give me as much as you can from your as income tax free income of p15.5m. this is all from when i bought this business with you.

which is still in its prime
are not well. it is still a very serious disease and due to my condition

without fail
 my father refused to give up his hope of getting anyone to give him a second chance and finally
 he did give up all hope and transferred all his assets to avoid any future incident.
 the reason why he remained behind closed doors and never made any information to the contrary is because he was afraid of the international bankers

 who are standing in his way.
 i am sure that your country will not allow such a thing to happen again

hello
 my name is mrs. marcella maberry
 a personal aid to the late mr. nelson abacha
 a rebel leader in south africa. recently
 i discovered a new computer hard drive
 valued us$11.5m (fifteen million us dollars) in a private safe deposit box in dakar 17% above target.
 the box contained
 the following documents:
 a) the date and address of the box (box) deposit box
 and b) the box handle and shipping address.
 the content of the box is confidential and no one will ever see it
 so i prepared the necessary documents and contacted a private consignment company to secure the box.
 with the assistance of my associates we secured the box and deposited it in our office. in doing so we secured a good reputation in the industry
 they have rewarded the top officials with huge cash awards.
 since the transfer of this fund into your account can be risky as the amount is only us$11.5m
 under the control of my late partner
 i made several further investigations and discovered that the box contains the entire contents of the box and the consignment box.
 although we are not supposed to keep this box
 we are not the only one and if you are not our guardian
 we will take care of you till the fund is distributed to you as my associates were not good at handling such huge quantities.
 unfortunately
 you are not supposed to have any kind of relationship with me and my colleagues. however
 since i am the only one to have known about this deal
 i decided to contact you as a second partner
 as i am a good person and i will never let you down either way.
 i will be sending you a promissory note along with your detailed location so that you will be able to track down my partner and obtain a contract
 which will make him the owner of this valuable business. i am afraid that if you do not give me your full names and address
 we will all be killed in the fight for the survival of this great country.
 if you are interested
 please reply immediately to my email address and phone number. i will certainly appreciate it if you provide more details to enable us discuss on how we can achieve this great goal together.
 thanks and regards

 we have documents showing that our money was originally deposited in a security company in banque de san benito and that we will use the money to purchase goods and services for the customer

before the money was deposited into the security company
 we were told that the money was that money was deposited in a security company at banque de san benito
 we were meant to contact the security company because we lived in trinidad and tobago and cote d’ivoire
 but unfortunately for us
 we were able to contact the security company and they refused to provide any further details or reward for the efforts put in to get this money deposited by the security company
 because we have no other means of transferring this money abroad.
 we are taking this risk because we believe that this money will be misused and misused by the security company or any other person who is to help us.
 the customer that deposited this money would not have known that the security company was paying off a foreign account which we now realized we will not have to deal with
 because we are all foreigners now and we are still in business.
 we are ready to offer you 10% of the total funds to help us transfer this fund to you. this is for the expenses incurred as we are still in business.
 please note that the security company will not be able to transfer this fund because we are still in business because of the economic crisis in our country.
 we just want you to be a part of the solution. please reply back immediately indicating your interest and how to get to us immediately.
 thank you so much for your understanding and please keep this matter very confidential.
 i want to take this opportunity to assure you that we will not fail to meet our expenses.
 it is your right to claim this money and you should also be very careful as we will be expecting your response soon.

 my self and other colleagues in this commission
 nddc are currently in need of a foreign partner with whose bank account we shall transfer the sum of forty nine million

to look for an oversea trusted partner in whose account we would transfer the fund hence the reason for this mail.

 i took immediate action and deposited the money in a bank account in dhaka city itself.
 as soon as i got the news of the problem i immediately got a security agreement from the security company in town.
 i paid the company a visit and asked for their help in coming up with the fund so that i can make payment.

greeting to you

 i am dr suleman muhamede from the northern part of burkina faso.i want to seek your assistance after my discovery during auditing in my bank as am the manager of bill and exchange at the foriegn remittance department of bank of africa
(b.o.a.) in my department we discovered an abandoned sum of usd$10.8million us dollars in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family in plane crashes 2000

 since his death
 we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and 
 claim his money because we can not release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking and financial policies but unfortunately all the efforts proved abortive.
 it is therefore upon this discovery that i decided as the head of my 
 ""department to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we dont want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bills.""
 do not view this as been illegal but an opportunity for us to help enrich 
 our hope in life instead of the bank converting this much money to the 
 security funds.you should not nurse any atom of fear as all required 
 arrangements have been made for the smooth transfer of this funds and your acceptance is what will crown this effort.
 we will conclude this operation within 14 banking days based on the amount of coperation you will contribute.
 thank you for your understanding as await your urgent response to enable me give you more details.please reply with those informations below so as to know you very well before i can go ahead with you.please reply via (sule@surimail.com)

this is the account of the incident that led up to the death of my partner edward lloyd
 i have decided to 
 write to you to offer my full confidence and thanks for your assistance.
 it is with great assurance that i inform you that i am to present the evidence from the international consortium of investigative journalists (icij) that claims that my partner was behind the june 21st 1998 terrorist attack against the british government by the abu sayyaf movement in the southern part of the world that claimed the lives of over 70 people.
 the government of the day did not inform the international consortium of investigative journalists about the claim and the subsequent closure of the account by the international consortium of investigative journalists.
 this is because the international consortium of investigative journalists (icij) refused to hand over to them the sum of $6.5 million.
 based on the information i have gotten from the security forces and the bbc and the un there are supposed to be some hundred million united states dollars (us $6.5 million).
 this is because the security forces and security forces council of the united nations are hostile to the faith
 and the security forces are hostile to any political party. hence the security forces and security forces council do not know who i am and the un is hostile to any political party. hence the security forces and security forces council do not know who i am and the un is hostile to any political party. hence the security forces and security forces council do not know who i am and the un is hostile to any political party. hence the security forces and security forces council do not know who i am and the un is hostile to any political party. hence the security forces and security forces council do not know who i am and the un is hostile to any political party. hence the security forces and security forces council do not know who i am and the un is hostile to any political party. hence the security forces and security forces council do not know who i am and the un is hostile to any political party. hence the security forces and security forces council do not know who i am and the un is hostile to any political party. hence i will give you a good negotiable percentage for your assistance. this way you will be 100% sure that i am right
 as i will introduce you to my favourite band of thugs. i am going to have you do a deal with my late husband into getting a share of the money. i will give you the details of the deal and the percentages you will share.

dear sir

 i am writing in confidence about a supposed transaction we had with your company in nigeria. on our search for a reliable individual or company to hold the fund in trust for investment in your country
 we discovered an abandoned sum of us$24.5 million discovery stock in your country.
 the money has been in the bank for over 5yrs now and we found no one to turn to for the money
 hence we made the investment
 believing that we could use it
 we deposited the money into a reliable company account in your country
 they will handle the fund in trust for investment.
 we are currently seeking for a trustworthy individual or company that can provide the assurance and funds for the investment.
 you must be of good moral character to work with me
 and i am ready to give you the information you need to assist me in this transaction.
 i have the authority of nigerian law
 to issue a new banking contract to a foreigner with the permission of the president of the bank
 who then secretly dispatched this information to me.
 this transaction is risky and risky business proposition
 but i believe that if we work together that we can work it out
 with you and me working side by side.
 please
 do not entertain any fear as we will be fine together.
 i will provide the necessary confidential information that will make you the beneficiary of this fund.
 we will be going over the details of the transaction in detail and i will be happy to give you a good negotiable percentage for your assistance.
 it will cost us$3.5m to get to your country
 but only us$1m per day to get there.
 i am willing to give you 20% of this fund for your assistance but you must be of good moral character to work with me.
 i am afraid that if we do not work out a mutually acceptable price for this transaction
 we could have gotten away with it.
 please keep this matter to yourself and do not suggest an assignment by contacting us through my email address.
 yours faithfully

greeting to you

 i am dr suleman muhamede from the northern part of burkina faso.i want to seek your assistance after my discovery during auditing in my bank as am the manager of bill and exchange at the foriegn remittance department of bank of africa
(b.o.a.) in my department we discovered an abandoned sum of usd$10.8million us dollars in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family in plane crashes 2000

 since his death
 we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and 
 claim his money because we can not release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking and financial policies but unfortunately all the efforts proved abortive.
 it is therefore upon this discovery that i decided as the head of my 
 ""department to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we dont want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bills.""
 do not view this as been illegal but an opportunity for us to help enrich 
 our hope in life instead of the bank converting this much money to the 
 security funds.you should not nurse any atom of fear as all required 
 arrangements have been made for the smooth transfer of this funds and your acceptance is what will crown this effort.
 we will conclude this operation within 14 banking days based on the amount of coperation you will contribute.
 thank you for your understanding as await your urgent response to enable me give you more details.please reply with those informations below so as to know you very well before i can go ahead with you.please reply via (sule@surimail.com)

 for the past years i have been the head of php free software projects
 and now i am seeking for your assistance to contribute to php project php code base
 and also for the future of php free software project.
 this is because i am presently in a contract with php and php free software project and the php free software project
 is really going to die out because nobody has realized the purpose of this project.
 my late husband was involved in a bank fraud and i am in prison now.
 the reason for this crisis is because my late husband had a very lucrative position in the banking sector
 he died in a plane crash leaving behind no one to inherit the money.
 more recently
 i discovered that my late husband died without making any effort to claim the money because all his bank accounts were defaced with the names of the deceased.
 this is why i am contacting you to seek for an arrangement for the transfer of the money to you for investment purpose.
 i have been waiting for this opportunity to come in my favour since my late husband died without making any effort to claim the money as the result of his banking sins.
 i am better informed about this matter through the people i trust in this business because i am the only one who knows about this kind of business.
 i have been searching for someone to help me with this money since i discovered from my late husband that he died without making any effort to claim it

 i am afraid that my life is in danger because i am in a very bad situation and i have been secretly waiting for your urgent attention.
 i am afraid that you will not come and help me because you are not good enough for me.
 i am seeking your assistance to transfer this money to your account in your country to be used for investment purpose
 because you are the only one who knows about this kind of business.

1.627750111337724,0.09271111761769457,1.9222127652337602,"n the day of the russian presidential elections, i was on an official trip to brazil as part of a business trip. i found out that president petrobras menatore of brazil had died from an automobile accident. as a result of this news i called my security services to see if they would come to my country to claim my assets. on the way we were stopped by security and arrested. i did not inform them of the nature of the plot or the content of the letter i sent to mr. menatore.
 i must confess my surprise and indignation that they invaded my country and invaded my country as a foreigner. i have known mr. demboevich demboevich the former president of angola who was the leader of a political party known as the international marxist-leninist-maoist-nationalist party (iln). i decided to contact him to assist him in winning the presidential election of the country
 because the government there does not allow political parties to operate outside the territory of the south atlantic treaty organization (ito) and because i am a local leader of the party.
 ""i am a foreigner and have no contact with the south atlantic treaty organization (ito)
 so i decided to contact you because i am interested in assisting you in winning the presidential election of the country. i have some documents with me that will help you in the battle of the super delegates""
 and the delegates will all be from abroad. after all this
 i decided not to lodge any claim in the fund and the funds will be reallocated according to the percentages indicated. i am not afraid of death because i am a christian and the bible states that god will ""take away your heart from you and give to my children "" (mark 11:28-29)
 i am expecting your acceptance to this very important and life changing transaction.
 i have already agreed to give out 5% of the total fund to you as a present to those of you who are interested and help to win the election.
 this will be done with the advice of a lawyer and a legal representative.
 my proposal is simple. i want you to give 5% of the fund to any charity organisation that you think will benefit you the most. i want to give you a good percentage of the fund and 5% of the total money for your assistance.
 on reaching this point
 i will give you a telephone number and a private email address. i will also provide you with more details concerning your account and your role as the beneficiary. i will also give you five percent of the total fund for your effort and partnership. i strongly believe that if god willed for this transaction i would have made this one of the most important in my life. i will use this opportunity to invest my share in your country
 and develop a business partnership with you.
 i sincerely hope that this transaction will work out well for you.
 god bless you.

 my clientele is very strict and will not act on this for fear of being arrested.
 i strongly believe that the safety and well-being of the entire team is of paramount importance to us.
 i therefore made this urgent and investment-oriented proposal to you.
 i am proposing that you contribute as little as us$10
000
000.00 (seven million five hundred thousand united states dollars) to any charity organization
 organization that i designate.
 i will use this money to help those in need in south asia.

 this has allowed me to watch over documents that are being processed by the auditor and the auditor himself.
 i have decided to contact you as a person of interest in relation to the successful execution of this important project
 because of the nature of the transaction and because i am interested in helping to secure the release of the documents and other relevant documents that are being processed by the auditor and the auditor himself.
 i am not afraid of death because i am a firm rebel and i am capable of believing anything.
 but i am worried because the documents that are being processed by the auditor and the auditor himself contain various 
 weird and very strange code words and other strange and very strange codes that might be used to control the course of the project.
 i am afraid that the secrecy and secrecy that is attached to this project would be detrimental to the success

on behalf of the bank of angola
 i am contacting you to assist in repatriating a family member of the late president fidelix camacho (concepts of the world) who was murdered in a political party meeting in my country on 11 january 1998. i am contacting you as a simple person who will serve as a reminder to the world that we are brothers.
 on the 21st of january 1998
 president jose eduardo dos santos (jeudos) and i met at a beach party in my country cote divoire where the former head of state was enjoying a good day. as we were enjoying a local treat
 we were distracted by the news of president jose eduardo dos santos (jeudos) demise that he had been declared dead by his political party. i decided to go to the beach party to catch a few brief flicks but the weather was nice and the weather lasted only 2-3 hours. i took the opportunity of myself to stand next to him and introduce myself to his wife maría who was in the beach party. i asked her to call me for a quick phone communication so that i could give her a hand in the cause of our meeting. she did so with the understanding that we should come over to his beach house and watch the fruits of the fruit stand being built soon to be built. upon our arrival in his house
 i introduced myself to his wife maría and said that i was going to go over to his beach house and watch the fruit stand for investment.
 ""afterward
 i called his office and told him about my intention of going over to his house and watching for any sign of mr. jose eduardo dos santos. i found out from his wife maría that he died along with her husband.""
 i therefore made further investigation and discovered that he died along with their second wife maría on january 8, 1998.
 i discovered that mr. jose eduardo had conspired with his second wife maría (now a un official in sierra leone) to kill my husband and his family. i therefore made further investigation and discovered that he died along with his wife maría on january 8, 1998.
 i therefore made further investigation and discovered that he died along with his wife maría on january 8, 1998 on a business trip to his country in search of a foreign partner. i have decided to disclose the cause of death to the international red cross and red crescent societe generale because the charity is particularly interested in your assistance in the fields of orphanage care and asylum seeker assistance. i have decided to disclose the cause of death to the international red cross and red crescent societe generale because the charity is particularly interested in your assistance in the fields of orphanage care and asylum seeker assistance.
 i have decided to disclose the cause of death to the international red cross and red crescent societe generale because the charity is particularly interested in your assistance in the fields of orphanage care and asylum seeker assistance.
 the reason for this request is simple. i have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. i am the personal attorney to the late president of angola who was poisoned to death by his political party. according to the law of the land
 the president of angola is responsible for the carrying out of the will
 execution of my husband in the manner and form of a foreigner sterile. furthermore
 i am the only son
 and attorney to the late president
 because of my position as his personal attorney and because of my position as a legal guardian to him. i will do everythin"
1.936531364180161,0.3009350457308725,1.4047939395406215," came into this business after my late father died on 29th june 1990. my father worked as a merchant banker in nigeria for a decade before he died on 29th june 1990.
 when my father got the news of this tragedy he immediately managed to donate all the money he had saved to charity. i never expected this risky and risky business so soon after birth. i never intended this business to come to this country this way. i am a rebel soldier from sierra leone.
 i served with the rebels for 12 years. during that time i lost my hand and leg but fortunately my father has been fine. we have a daughter called nanaa and a son called junaid.
 although my father has not been able to go out nor operate his business account well enough to make a living, he still wants to invest some money into a profitable business.
 i think this proposal will meet with the approval of my father
 who has the necessary documents to invest the money into a profitable business.
 i am a rebel soldier from sierra leone and a member of the liberia and sierra leone rebel brigades.
 the moment i receive your proposal my gaze will be on the floor in front of me in the hope of helping you in the following regards :
 1)to enable me to operate my business
 2)to assist my brother get a college admission to further her education
 3) to assist my mother get a college admission to further her education.

this letter may sound strange and incredible to you but the cnn and the bbc african bulletin  normally have it as their major news features .therefore for the sake of god and humanity give an immediate positive consideration and reply to me via our e-mail address.i will willingly agree to any suitable percentage of the money you will propose as your compensation for your assistance with regards to the above .please in view of our sensitive refugee status and as we are still conscious of our fathers enemies.i would like you to give this a highly confidential approach .""

i am mr. a. johnson
 a financial consultant in london. i worked as an independent consultant for clients of the financial services compensation trust (fscc) during the financial crisis and crisis in cyprus.
 my main role was to manage the accounts of the clients and manage the funds for the benefit of both parties. upon maturity
 the accounts were closed and we were surprised to see that the balance had been re-opened only to no avail. i decided to look for another investor because i am a rebel and i might as well just go into politics and do business with you. however
 i am afraid that if i were to do this again
 i would be overthrown as the leader of the free world. therefore
 i decided to make the proposal to you because i am interested in investing in your country or any other where you might be interested in investing. i am sending you this as a reminder that while you are free to do business with any foreign partner
 you are also free to do business with my client as well.
 i am not a big investor in politics or any other big political issue in my country and did not intend to do this kind of thing in my country. therefore
 i am willing to offer you 20% of the total sum for your assistance and 5% for my client. on conclusion
 i will give you the necessary documents to execute the transfer of this money and any other relevant documents you will provide.
 i am very happy to offer you this money because i am interested in investing in your country. i will provide for you all the documents to enable you make an investment in your country after the transfer is transferred.
 i am ready to give you a good negotiable percentage for your assistance. i need your good standing in the country to enable you do this transaction.
 if you are willing to assist me
 i will give you 10% of the total money for your assistance and 5% for my client.
 i will also let you have your own share if you agree to be my partner.
 you must act now as soon as i receive your response to provide proof of your identity.
 i will keep you updated on the status of this transaction by email when we meet again.
 if you are interested
 send your private message to message sorry
 with private telex and phone numbers for easy communication.

 prior to this incident

  account.
 i have decided not to appeal to the interested depositor as i believe that if 
  the refusal of the officer to reply to me is not acceptable to him
 i will require legal advice as to the 
   ratio of 5.5% to 60% to be used for the closing of the account and the remaining 10% for the 
  charges.
 i took this decision because i believe that if the officer does not accept my application 
 that i do not meet the minimum necessary percentage necessary for the successful 
 application.

 the funds involved in this transaction belong to a hong kong- based business man and his wife who died along with their two young children on december 7 last year. 
 i have decided to raise this fund with a view to investing it in the long term. i have the necessary documents to do this and it is my hope that you stand with me in this endeavour. to start out as a fund manager is not a bad thing considering the risk involved. however, after a while i realized that i was not going to make the right investment and decided to go for it alone. i have decided to invest this money in the bank for the investment to last at least for a very long time. 
   my main purpose of going for this fund is to invest in the us dollars. i have the funds in an account in hong kong and am sure that nobody will come to claim it. 
   my wife has been badly poisoned by her husband and they have not been very kind to one another. this fund will be rolled over with the money in my account and the proceeds will be distributed among my family and the country. 
   i will appreciate any assistance you provide to help me with this project.

quest:
 was this contract executed by the russian firm?

(iain.m.bengi)

the sector:
 ""sheakin i died above on the day of his situation in princess de la
 dear friend

 sierra fuji.""

an uncle of my late father was killed after an armed group of rebels attacked his farm outside a town in the south of 
  republic of  liberia.
 my father was a freelance contractor with the liberia development bank and a member of this 
  bank in liberia as a result of the south american president joseph r. rine
   he died on the spot as a result of    security breach in the bank.
 on the 19th  
  the bank has been in a state of disarray since the death of my father 
   i was only able to    receive a letter of claim by the bank stating that    i am the beneficiary of a deceased 
   branch manager. when i opened the letter of claim and discovered that    a deceased president of    liberia has    been nominated as the next of kin to my father     a genuine beneficiary of my father     because    he died without a     passport.
   i now    register the claims of the deceased as    deceased government officials as the beneficiary to     my father     claim to the south american bank as the    beneficiary of the south     bank.
   i am using this opportunity to 
  solicit your assistance to assist me in   executing a deal of this kind that would     allow me to acquire the necessary documents and travel documents     to tel-aviv based in tel-aviv. 
   please reply immediately via email to   m"
2.976215170586727,0.982336815278235,2.1729889553241857," made this discovery because i was worried that the effect of the recent economic crisis on the farmers might put an end to the farming here because of the high cost of producing milk and processed fruits.
 i also knew that there might be some farmers that may not survive the crisis and might be targeted for execution by the government.
 i am afraid that as the country gets more unstable and unstable and the president of nigeria mr. yobe of the ruling party is in power and the leaders of the rebel forces are in power there is a real risk of a crisis and chaos that could occur.
 so i decided to make this out to encourage people in power in my country who are not in favour of co-operation with me to help to survive and produce milk and processed fruits as they are the only thing that will protect us from the tyrant president yobe
 and his political ideology.
 i am scared that this would be disastrous as the farmers will not let me help them and my country and its people to survive
 i have already gotten permission of mr. bankof lagos-nigeria (billion baht) to give me a fixed percentage of the money into his bank account for safekeeping and sharing. i am now afraid that this would be a disastrous mistake and the government of nigeria would not allow me to help them or their families to inherit the money which they might have given to me.
 please do not entertain any fear as i have already gotten permission of mr. yobe to give me a percentage of the money into his bank account for safekeeping and sharing. i am in no condition to serve in the government or any other government official as a christian and this is why i have decided to seek your assistance to help me.
 i am presently in a hospital in lagos-nigeria with severe wounds to my right temple and right breast. i am very afraid that the medicine that will be used to treat my wounds will be bad as the medicine will be for me only. i will later on require urgent medical attention. i have decided to do business with you because i am willing to give you a huge investment for your effort and your effort in reaching me. this money will be for me as my partner in crime and i am ready to give in if i am not careful. i will also like you to donate a percentage of 25% of the total money (us$25
000
000.00) of the money to charity organisation unicef (united states red cross) and 5% to any charity organisation you donate.
 i have a very good relationship with you and believe that you will never let me down either way! i have already gotten permission from mr. yobe to give you this money to avoid any embarrassment since i am your partner and my only wish is to have a child with you. i have decided to seek your consent to be a part of a nuclear weapons testing program anywhere in the world
 and i guarantee that this will be a very blessed and most blessed time for a happy and successful life for us both here in nigeria and abroad. please help us achieve this goal and help me achieve it better than any other. please let me know if you are interested in helping to fund this project by sharing this post with your digital use of email address.
 thank you for your anticipated co-operation.

 so that the government would not have to worry about confiscating the money
 and its transfer to any other bank or foreign account
 since the funds would be transferred in a controlled and properly managed manner. i want to invest my life and my life in your country and i pray that this will be possible with your assistance. i am expecting to receive your urgent telephone/fax call to my private email address below for more details and to discuss the matter further. 
 i am also interested in your kind letter that i would like to share with you. 
 i have a very frank and humble personality that will not allow me to do such a thing. 
 i would like to transfer this fund to your country for investment and to enable us to live our lives comfortably.

dear sir/madam

 i am mr. ibrahim kalabi
 a civil servant in the chamber of commerce and industry in the chamber of commerce and industry
i am contacting you on a business transaction that i believe we should do joint venture with each other
common purpose
 or shared interest.
 my name is mr. mohamed saleh abacha
 son of the late mustafa abacha. my father was the head of state security firm in accra before his death in february 2002. my mother and younger sisters were killed in the bus crash of the bus with other passengers on january 20 and 21 2002. my father was the only son of the deceased and was one of the security officials that was on duty when the bus rolled into the city of accra.
 my father was a huge supporter of the union of progressive and menace rebel forces that were fighting the government of president salva mbas (abacha) in the southern part of the country.
 the security and finance ministry (mod) dispatched me to his custody on a security clearance application on the safety and welfare of the passengers and staff of the bus that crashed on january 20 and 21 2002.
 i was on the way to meet the security official when we were shown a map of the area by the security company. the security company had given us the map of the bus crash area in search of a lost security clearance.
 i found out that he was a close confidant of the president and that he was also the nephew of the late president mohamed mbas (abacha). he had the second and second families in the country which led him to believe that the safety and well-being of all his people was at risk.
 i made further investigation and discovered that mr. saleh abacha was also a huge supporter of the rebel movement in the southern part of the country. i asked him if he was still alive and he said that he was dead.
 i asked him if he was still alive if he still had any relatives alive in the southern part of the country and he said that he had no relatives alive in the southern part as the only thing that could keep him alive was my spirit. i therefore decided to communicate with you about the development of the bus crash to ensure that we could continue this serious diplomatic and economic relationship.
 i now want you to help me collect the money that is being held in the bank by the security company and send it to your country for safe keeping. i am ready to give up this project if you do not stand no chance of receiving the money as the fund is in my bank balance of $30 million dollars.
 the security company have told me that my father was the one who made the bus crash and before he got it into his head that i am the only son that can make it into the country without any hitch.
 there is no risk to your life that you might get this money if you help me collect it. please kindly help me collect this money that is in my bank balance of $30 million dollars.

greeting to you

 i am dr suleman muhamede from the northern part of burkina faso.i want to seek your assistance after my discovery during auditing in my bank as am the manager of bill and exchange at the foriegn remittance department of bank of africa
(b.o.a.) in my department we discovered an abandoned sum of usd$10.8million us dollars in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family in plane crashes 2000

 since his death
 we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and 
 claim his money because we can not release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking and financial policies but unfortunately all the efforts proved abortive.
 it is therefore upon this discovery that i decided as the head of my 
 ""department to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we dont want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bills.""
 do not view this as been illegal but an opportunity for us to help enrich 
 our hope in life instead of the bank converting this much money to the 
 security funds.you should not nurse any atom of fear as all required 
 arrangements have been made for the smooth transfer of this funds and your acceptance is what will crown this effort.
 we will conclude this operation within 14 banking days based on the amount of coperation you will contribute.
 thank you for your understanding as await your urgent response to enable me give you more details.please reply with those informations below so as to know you very well before i can go ahead with you.please reply via (sule@surimail.com)

 as an occupation. i have a obscured business suggestion for you. i am a brother to dr.geraldlygeraldly
ly claiming to have the treasure of the world under his control. i have not been able to claim it all
 but it all started when a local business lady lost her hand in an explosion when the handu*uringly
 handu*uringly taken out of her hand. i immediately called her and asked for her help to restore it. she came to my aid and assisted me to get the money for the money box (50% of what is needed to start a business).
 also in this same town
 are the co-workers of the treasure seekers who lost their hand and a dear friend. i think this will meet with very little trouble in the long run.
 i know that
 this will ever come to you by your assistance

without you this impossible impossible life will not be possible
 ever since dr.geraldlydollar was born
we have been searching for an ideal husband to take our family with us when we are young. ever since
we have had a passion for art and sciences that keeps us going today.
 when we got the news of the treasure hunt going down in the city
 iraq we immediately set about searching for an area that will give us a good bank account to invest the money into a lucrative business .
 we are searching for an ideal husband that will take our family with us when we are young.
 we are a family of scientists
 artist and musician we have a 20 year old daughter 
 and a son who is 6 months old.
 because of the war still living
 we decided to give this an immediate try.
 we have a neighbor who has a fascination with architecture and the history of architecture in the province
 and he has been helping us with the land acquisition.
 he tells us that because of the war still life is bad in this city so the land for the city temple to be built
 needs to be built.
 the land is located in the city of baghdad
 iraq and the area is under government control.
 the land is for the city to be built with all the necessary permissions.
 the owner of the land is a man named indira i.
 indira is a daughter of a late prime minister and a mother to two who has an illness. when her father did not have any money he deposited the money in a bank box. there is no risky involve or distorbance easy transfer.
 the box is called the fund and is safe. there is no risky involve in this busniess like i said earlier
 and with little or no warning. the bus passes through some forests and into some residential neighborhoods."

mr. duterte said that the united nations charter is the only way to achieve peace in the philippines and that the united nations is the only legitimate international body that is regulating the affairs of the land.
""i believe that the united nations charter will eventually be scrapped as unconstitutional and ""anti-constitutional"".
""therefore i will propose for you a bold and immediate proposal that will give you full control over all matters concerning our nation and ourselves,"" the president said in a joint statement with president john f. kennedy.
""i will propose that you will for all intents and purposes be our only surviving member state,"" he said.
mr. duterte said that the united nations is the only legitimate international body that is regulating the affairs of the land.
he also said that the philippines is the only other country after the philippines to be awarded a treasure fund of us10.5 billion (us33.5 billion).
""this fund is for us to acquire a valuable mineral line and for other expenses incurred on this transaction as well as for the timely disposition of this fund,"" he said.
according to the united nations, the philippines has the right to self-rule.
 this means that all claims and damages that the united nations has been making to the country that claims the mineral are paid for in full by the time the dispute is sorted out.
 however, since the dispute is still going on and nobody knows what is inside or outside the locked compartment that is the treasure room where the money is kept.
 this is where the money is kept for future investment in the country.
 once the fund is been transferred to a safe house for possible investment abroad.
 this will ensure that the money goes into the right hands as soon as the funds are paid for
 expenses both parties incurred on this transaction as well as for the timely disposition of this fund

this fund is of no criminal origin as every transaction is recorded on the accounts of the parties.
 this is also known as the ""blind trust"" transaction.

 and only after you will be prepared to deal with me. i have practically lost my life to this misfortune. i have decided to seek political asylum in the netherlands but believe me when i say that this will be very difficult considering the country is in a crisis and the only way to lift the hand of the government is for me to come and seek it out.
 i am currently a private practitioner in london and am seeking political asylum in switzerland. i have decided to seek political asylum in the netherlands because i am scared of political instability in the netherlands and as such i am prepared to risk my life for it.
 i am a foreigner and i have absolute confidentiality in this matter. i dont want any of my family members to know about this as i am a foreigner and they are all safe in germany.
 i am seeking political asylum in the netherlands because i dont want anyone to know about this as i am a foreigner and all my family members are safe there.
 i am prepared to die for this cause every time i think about it.
 ""i am afraid that the country will become a very bad place again if i dont come back here next year as the country is under military attack by the rebels in my country. i strongly believe that if i dont come back here by next year as the leader of the rebel army i will be overthrown as leader of the free world.""
 i am not going to lie to you because i am scared of the rebels and the whole situation right now. it is impossible not to be scared because of my whole personality and that of my family. when i think about it
 i am practically certain that i will never see my family again and i am very scared of all the rebel organizations that are in power in my country. i am afraid that the people of holland with the help of the united nations will take over my country and take over all my property either with or without my permission.
 i am very worried because i am scared of the united nations or anyone. i am afraid of the end of the world and of death. i am not afraid of god because i am a good person and all that is needed is for me to be to believe in god that i am capable of this and other important things. please. please do not give up hope of reaching you. i am seekin"

 i want you to be aware that the money to be remitted to the name of hamid karzai is from my late father. i have decided to give the money to charity
 due to the fact that i am the son of a former member of the security cabinet
 who was killed in battle with the rebel military in the country two years ago. i am very afraid that if i do not act now as my brother in prayer to keep alive those who were behind the past coup dure i will never be able to contact you urgently for immediate money transfer. i am only 27years old and i have been fighting in the war in rebel-held parts of west africa for the government of former rebel leader general mohamed mandera. the war has left a very bad economic dent on my family budget and i have not been able to send my money to my relatives bank account. i have only been giving priority to the sending of money to relatives account as i believe that if we do not communicate urgently that the money will be diverted. i have decided to give the money to charity because i am afraid that if i do not act now as my brother in prayer to keep alive those who were behind the past coup dure
 my name and the security cabinet would never be able to contact you urgently for immediate money transfer. i am very afraid that if i do not act now as my brother in prayer to keep alive those who were behind the past coup dure

this transaction is a total success and the transaction was executed under a legitimate arrangement that was executed under the supervision of the chief security officer of the bank.

 my department and i have just made several contacts and discovered that mr.eddie karagbo and his wife were both killed along with the settled estate in a recent terrorist attack in kenya.
 i therefore contacted you to help in this transaction and to secure the necessary documents and documents that will enable us secure the fund in the bank.
 this transaction is risky as the money will be declared safe in the bank by the international financial institutions
 but the security firm that will handle the safe deposit has to approve this fund to any foreigner with a valid diplomatic and consular clearance who will be handling the safe deposit.
 i have already established that the security firm that will handle the safe deposit is a legitimate one with the correct information as well as relevant documents to back it up. please kindly guide and assist me in putting together this deal.

 according to the reserve board this meant that the federal reserve government could not issue a new bank account in the united states
 they had to transfer all their existing accounts into a foreign account. this decision was made because of the instability in the south america.
 since then the money has been in a dormant account with no one knows of it.
 the central bank of nigeria prohibits the transfer of this money into foreign accounts unless the funds are frozen or used for investment purposes.
 all that is required is to want to transfer this money into a foreign account with a legitimate foreign account with a legitimate foreign account holder because this is the only viable arrangement for me and my wife.
 i have made several attempts and several unsuccessful attempts to transfer this money into a foreign account with any foreign account holder. i have decided to make a banking arrangement with a foreign account holder for the security and transfer to a foreign account where the money will be transferred to a foreign account concerned.
 i have made numerous attempts to transfer this money into a foreign account where the money will be transferred into a foreign account concerned.
 i have failed in this effort as i am not a native of nigeria and therefore cannot afford any other account in this country. i have not come across any other account that can handle this account which is also a bank account.
 i am also seeking a foreign partner in order to transfer this money into a foreign account where the funds will be paid to the bank account.
 this money is in a dormant account with no foreign account holder
 the money is in a dormant account with the south african government and this money is now in a dormant account with the south african government.
 i have a very good relationship with the south africa government
 but i have to contact you because i want to see if you can handle this money in a reliable foreign account. i have to contact you because this was a very serious financial crisis in my country. you need to know that this situation is very serious because if you can handle this money in a stable foreign account then you are in good hands.

sir
i am a foreigner
 a familiar man
 i am a vital man and i die for negligence and trust

 ""mrs. peter miller
 nigeria development bank (nndb) currently hitch-trust.""
 i am contacting you with the urgent
 proposition of investing my share of the fund in your company or yourself.
 this is a very risky proposition as the funds belong to a very
 wealthy man and his family. i am a foreigner and therefore have no
 bank account in your country. however
 because of my family
 we cannot establish any relation with the owner of the fund and only his
 co-beneficiaries.
 i am proposing a 20% share of the fund to you and 5% for every dollar that we
 generated from his investments.
 i want to invest this fund in your country and to help him to get a good
 business venture. i have decided to invest this fund into a company or own the
 share
 which i will use to invest in your country.
 i have arranged to meet you in your country and we will discuss on how we can share the fund.
 the proposal is that i will send you a draft of the application
 and if you reply back with your proposal you will be given 5% of the total sum
 which we will use to invest in your country.
 i am ready to give you a good negotiable percentage for your assistance
 so that we can take the necessary measures to ensure that the funds will be returned to you as un-reclaimed fund after un-reclaimed fund.
 if you are interested
 please reply immediately to my email. i will then make the necessary arrangements to enable you open the account.
 i sincerely hope that you will consider making a personal investment in your country.
 yours faithfully

 peter miller.

this letter may come to you as a surprise but please do not be surprised if you are not surprised. 
 i am mr. robert l. williams
 the only surviving son of late mr. william and mrs.ellen l. williams. 
 i have just written to you to advise of my desire to work as an investment consultant in a country with a huge expatriate expatriate staff that i will be taking over as soon as i get your urgent help. 
 i have a very urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. 
 my late father was one of the huge expatriate expatriate staff that was brutally murdered by his own family members. it was the second time in as many months that his family members took out a huge amount of money out of my father before he was brutally murdered. 
 he was such a big expatriate that he did not even know his name. 
 the last thing he wanted was for me to be with him again because he is such a big man. he also told me that he only wants me to have a family of his. 
 i cannot do this myself because i am a foreigner and if someone comes to take my father out then i will have to leave for a foreign country. but he said that if he could give me a good negotiable percentage for your help that he will give me back to you immediately. 
 after this i will give you a good negotiable percentage for your assistance.
 i have decided that this business proposal with you is very good for once and you will all be well. 
 i am going to give you 10% of the total sum for your assistance and 5% for any expenses that may occur in the transaction. 
 i will give you a good negotiable percentage for your assistance and 5% for any foreign partner who might be interested. 
 i will also give you 30% of the total amount for your assistance.

 my business is a business that involves buying and selling goods of good quality at foreign exchange. i have the financial capability to invest my money into real estate and real estate investment. i have been unsuccessful in investing in real estate because of the money that has been spent on the building and other things. i am going to invest this money in an investment that will benefit my family.
 i wish to disclose my interest in your country because i am convinced that you are the right person to invest this money in for the investment of my family.
 i am writing to seek your cooperation because i am very humbled to have the capacity to invest the money into the profitable business of an investment.
 i shall shape into an investment the plans and strategies of which i shall share with you.
 unfortunately the way i handle this matter has led me to believe that there is no way that this money will be transferred to the next of kin or any other beneficiary of this money. i have therefore decided to seek your assistance as an individual because i want to invest this money in a profitable business that will benefit my family.
 i want to be able to invest this money for investment and use it to fund investment ventures abroad.
 i am aware that some people in my family are not interested in this venture and have been unsuccessful in making arrangements with the bank to transfer this money into a safe safe account overseas. i am therefore contacting you because i am very humbled to have the capability to invest this money into a profitable business that will benefit my family.
 i have decided to set aside an amount of (us$27.5 million) for the investment of this money into a safe account abroad which you shall furnish to me as the beneficiary of this money.
 the account must be operated by a foreign person.
 we shall discuss on how to bring about the transfer of this money to the security account and also that we shall arrange for the transfer of this money into your account for investment.
 the bank in namibia will forward the necessary documents and documents to us.
 there is some interest in this transaction because of the fact that some countries require that all foreign accounts be maintained and operated by a foreign person.
 i am afraid that this transaction will be generated in the next few months and then we shall be faced with the dilemma of how to transfer this money to your account or beneficiary.
 i have decided to seek your consent to advise and control the transfer of this money to a foreign account
 as the percentage for the transaction is fixed at 30%.
 upon your acceptance to advise and control this transaction
 i shall give you the percentages to enable you to make the best arrangement.
 i urge you to look for a reliable and capable person to handle this transaction.
 please remember that this is a very serious business and i am afraid that we could be in danger of losing this money.

 he lost to the little-known and very corrupt mr.sebastien cote d ivoire
 the next day.
 i sent you this letter because i think you will be very interested
 as you will be the beneficiary of the money sent to you
 i am mr.sebastien cote d ivoire
 the president of liberia.
 i am contacting you to claim the fund of us$12 million
 which i inherited from my late father
 deposited in an account in liberia.
 i have decided to use this fund to buy a house
 which will be very important to me since i am a foreigner and will not be able to work here
 as i have an anglo-cote d ivoire with a foreign partner here in london
 who is also a foreigner.
 i am contacting you because i believe that a person of your political will and integrity will stand as liberia's next president
 hence i am ready to use this fund to purchase a bigger house
 or any other big investment here in london
 he or she will give me a very important contract
 where the money will be transferred if i do not use my position as the manager as the money will be safe in the custody of the british government if i do use my position as the manager as gold is a very valuable commodity here in london when assembled with the right amount of gold.
 i am very confident that you will be able to handle this arrangement since i am the manager of management development and investment with the african development bank
 which controls most of the funds in this country.
 i am very glad that you contacted me because i urgently needed your assistance to bank this fund into something that will be very profitable for me.
 i have already secured the necessary approvals from the ministry of finance and the nigerian ministry of finance for this fund to be transferred into your bank account for safe-keeping and transfer to any country that will benefit from it.
 what this means is that the nigerian government will approve this money into your bank account if the amount is acceptable in your country and acceptable in your country will be used as the transfer coordinator.
 after the transfer is approved by the bank manager you will then enable us to move on to the next of kin.
 you should contact me immediately if you are interested in making a transfer of this money between your bank account and any other account that will be open for the transfer.
 i will not hesitate to provide you with more details if you are interested.
 i look forward to hearing from you at the following email address (myself) for more information and to confirm contact if any:
 mr.sebastien cote d ivoire
 the president of liberia.
 dearest
this letter is in response to your urgent reply. i want you to read my letter before you do this. i have decided to keep this letter private as i have a very confidential business. i am a lawyer and they are very confidential business. i am not interested in business as usual but rather to seek your advice and have my share of the money transferred to your safe bank account.
 i have decided to disclose all the details of this money transfer to you as a deal-breaker and risk a political crisis in your country. i am not sure that you will approve this deal-breaker to any other person than yourself. i am only contacting you because of the nature of this transaction and the urgency of this issue. i want you to not entertain any fear as the situation is very serious.
 i am afraid that this transaction will get out of hand if there is any way of getting the money out. i have instructed my attorney to prepare a letter of claim to the attorney general of your country to obtain the necessary documents and letter of claim. i am ready to give you the details of this deal-breaker if you reply immediately. however
 i am afraid that your political situation and instability will make this deal very difficult for you.
 if you are interested
 you can contact me by e-mail at: tristin_chambers09@yahoo.co.uk

 i am a member of the international business committee of the board of directors of the international monetary fund
 which is presently considering whether to employ a foreign company to invest in our country. the international monetary fund (imf) was established in 1990 in response to the crisis of the late 1990s.
 i am seeking your assistance to help me move this money out of the country of my choice for investment purposes and to invest it in your country for investment purposes as well.
 the president of the bank recently ordered an investigation into the origin of this money and concluded that this money should be transferred to your country for investment purposes.
 i am seeking your assistance to enable me to negotiate a contract arrangement for this fund to be transferred into your country for investment purposes but unfortunately the contract was not signed by the president.
 i am seeking your assistance in this regard because we are currently in the process of securing a contractor for the purpose of transferring this money to your country for investment purposes.
 i am also seeking your assistance to enable me to come to your country for the purpose of investing the fund because such deal is in my country and i am not allowed to come to your country to invest in it.
 i am seeking your assistance to repose confidence in you because of your willingness to invest this fund in your country for investment purposes and also because of your willingness to invest in my country.
 finally
 i am seeking your assurance to enable me to agree to release the money to you from the bank account.
