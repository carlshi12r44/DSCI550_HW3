the security council security council bill of 21 june 1998\n this transaction will not be executed on my watch as the attorney-general of bulgaria has already indicated his intention of transferring

    " got your email address while searching for a reputable business partner. i was disappointed to find out that he did not have any bank account in bulgaria and that he operated a bank account there but he was not a resident of bulgaria. so i called his bank and told them and told them what i had done with my present deposit in his account but they refused to give me any more deposit so i called the bank and asked them to destroy the deposit. i decided to seek for a foreign partner because i am afraid that if i are not righted in the right way by the bank then they will confiscate my deposit and charge me anywhere from 10% until 65% of the total deposit will be for me.\n i also decided to seek for a foreign partner because i am afraid that if i are not righted in the right way by the bank then they will confiscate my deposit and charge me anywhere from 10% until 65% of the total deposit will be for me.\n i also decided to seek for a foreign partner because i am afraid that if i am not righted properly by the banking law that will render me not able to apply for a new job anywhere in the world as soon as i apply for a new job.\n considering the fact that the republic of bulgaria does not have a banking law that guarantees the safety and well-being of its depositor\n i am afraid that they will quickly lift the ban on my application for a new job and i will be out of the country pending my application for another.\n i also decided to seek for a foreigner because i am afraid that if my application is approved by the bank that will take care of the rest\n the money will be remitted to the bank unharmed.\n i also decided not to disclose the amount to anyone\n because i am afraid that if i did disclose the money to anybody\n it would be taken out of my name as the owner and all the documents that will be needed for my claim to be realized.\n my only regret is that i did not do this because i am afraid that i would be arrested by the security forces of bulgaria for trying to undermine the presidential will of the country. this is because the security forces have confiscated my computer hard drive and hard-drive for safe keeping. i am not afraid of death\n because i am a very good person and if there were any danger of my life\n i would give it all away to you. please keep this in mind when you apply.\n i will be contacting you through my alternative email for further details.\n yours sincerely.\n mr.mrs abbassin\n\n\"abbasin.\"\n email:mrsabbasin@yahoo.com\n\ni am mr. matthew abbasin\n a staff accountant with the international consortium of investigative journalists (icij). i have a very confidential and very confidential business proposition for you.\n on january 6\n 1999\n a group of british nationals (abbasin) invaded and took over a residential property in abidjan cote d ivoire\n and took over an individual (mamadou sissi) account. i did not expect this kind of thing to happen\n and i am very sorry for taking this opportunity to make this proposal. i was only twenty-one at the time of the incident\n but i was able to contact my past employers and obtain a foreign partner\n because i am the only son of late mamadou sissi who was the head of pr for a major bank in abidjan.\n the money was originally from my late husband\n which was worth a little more than us$15\n000\n000.00 (ft.f)\n which was deposited with a major bank in abidjan in the bank security deposit box.\n now that my husband is gone\n i can no longer go out and live my present life because the money was deposited with a major bank\n and the security deposit box (us$15\n000\n000.00) they have all been lying on for the past twelve months.\n i am really sorry for taking this opportunity and am very glad that you took it this way. i have unfortunately been in this business before\n because i am very good at dealing with relatives and friends.\n i am also very good at investing because i have a very good balance in the bank that i will part with as collateral if the bank does not provide me with the money.\n finally\n i have decided to go into exile in tunisia to avoid any further embarrassment for myself\n as i am not a danger to the whole world or my family\n as i have said before\n to do this deal with you. please regard this as a personal deal only and do not take any action which might affect my future\n endeavours to live a peaceful and kind life.\n i am ready to give you a good negotiable percentage for your assistance if you respond by e-mail.\n thanks and regards.\n mr. matthew abbasi",

    "nited nations (reuters) - a rebel leader in northern nigeria has been declared dead after he was shot dead by security forces on a routine security inspection visit to a hospital in lagos-nigeria state, officials said on friday.\n\nhe was identified by medical experts as mohammed ibrahim ateeq awad who was a member of the military government of president goodluck jonathan of the southern state of lagos-nigeria.\nthe medical experts said that awad had died from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head and that a subsequent investigation by medical experts had proved that he had no known family members to support the claim of death as the only known surviving son from the war in the country and therefore did not inherit the sum of $286 million\n ($420 million).\nthe medical experts said that because of the way the health of the president and the security services have been putting together over the past few years\n the security forces have not been able to locate any family member to carry out inheritances or transfer any property\n as the security code of ethics in south africa is strict and if a family member is not found to be a permanent resident of south africa\n the security forces will not be able to stop the family or transfer any property\n as the security forces have not been able to transfer any property at all to any international organisation that shares the same name as the security forces and that will act as his personal security company\n officials said.\nthe security forces have not confirmed the death to be a suicide and have not operated on any other relatives since the war in the country started in 2003\n but the fact that the security forces have not established any other relation to the president and his family\n has made the security forces decide to not inform anyone about the death since they are not supposed to know about the security forces.\n\"a medical doctor from the southern country who was with us in nigeria said that he saw no other relation to the president other than the security forces in the capital city city,\" a senior official said.\nthe security officials said that since the start of the war against the rebels in the southern states\n the security forces have not recognised any other relation to the president and his family\n unlike the security forces in south africa\n all the family members that have been declared dead or declared unserviceable\n the security officials said that since the beginning of the war in the southern states\n the security forces have not recognised any other relation to the president and his family\n unlike the security forces in south africa\n all the family members that have been declared dead or declared unserviceable\n the security officials said that since the beginning of the war in the southern states\n the security forces have not recognised any other relation to the president and his family\n unlike the security forces in south africa\n all the family members that have been declared dead or declared unserviceable\n the security officials said that since the start of the war in the southern states\n all the family members that have been declared dead or declared unserviceable\n have been relocated to a private hospital in lagos-nigeria.\n \"all the family members that have been declared dead or declared unserviceable\n has been relocated to a private hospital in lagos-nigeria. i am afraid that all the relatives that have been declared unserviceable will go into the hospital alive or be rendered unserviceable in the

    "ndrey khodorkin\n \n this is an urgent reply to \"south africa's most wanted person\"\n who died on the 8th of february 2000 in a plane crash on the atlantic ocean. i am a huge supporter of mr. mamou mandera who i have known for some time now. though i was not particularly involved in politics or any political ideology in my early years\ni found out about his death from an egyptian businessman and his wife who was killed in the plane crash. i believe that the death of mr. mamou mandera was the result of a drug overdose that he had on the occasion of his death. i therefore made further investigation and discovered that he had died without making a will or claiming any property in all his official documents\n including his bank deposit with the federal reserve bank of south africa. i strongly believe that the release of this money to the people of south africa was the real reason behind his death. however, i have discovered that his wife was not present as she had given birth to son on the last day of his life and that his only source of income came from the diamond and cocoa industry here in johannesburg\n which accounts for more than 70% of his total total assets. i therefore decided to search for a foreign partner in the same country and only obtain the funds for my own benefit from the discovery of his death. i have the power to make this happen and in doing so\n i have secured the release of the deposited fund for me. i have agreed to give out 35% of the total sum to any foreigner interested in investing in my country. i have also made arrangements to meet with the head of government of south africa to negotiate a mutually agreed upon percentage for us to work together on.\n i am requesting that you prepare this document so that the public can understand and accept the fact that i am a huge supporter of mr. mamou mandera. i am proposing that you do everything in your power to ensure that this deal is carried out through the open and honest of your heart. this transaction would be 100% risk-free as no risk at all must occur.\n this transaction would be 100% risky if not for the cooperation of the two of us. i have instructed my attorney to prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will secure the release of the money pending further investigation.\n please reply immediately via this private email address if you are interested in this transaction. i look forward to hearing from you immediately.\n sincerely\n\n mr. mamou mandera\n\ndirector\n commercial bank\n commercial bank\n johannesburg\n\n south africa\n email:mamoum1@myway.com\n thanks and regards.\n\nbill moyers\n general accounting office\n box 554\nattention: financial accounting branch\n branch\n box 554\nattention: financial accounting branch\n box 554\nattention: financial accounting branch\n box 554\nattention: financial accounting branch\n box 554\nattention: financial accounting branch\n box 554\nattention: financial accounting branch\n box 554\nattention: financial accounting branch\n box 554\nattention: financial accounting branch\n box 554\nattention: financial accounting branch\n box 554\nattention: financial accounting branch\n box 554\nattention: financial accounting branch\n box 554\nattention: financial accounting branch\n box 554\nattention: financial accounting branch\n box 554\nattention: financial accounting branch\n box 554\nattention: financial accounting branch\n box 554\nattention: financial accounting branch\n box 554\nattention: financial accounting branch\n box 554\nattention: financial accounting branch\n box 554\nattention: financial accounting branch\n box 554\nattention: financial accounting branch\n box 554\nattention: financial accounting branch\n box 554\nattention: financial accounting branch\n box 554\nattention: financial accounting branch\n box 554\nattention: financial accounting branch\n box 554\nattention: financial accounting branch\n box 554\nattention: financial accounting branch\n box 554\nattention: financial accounting branch\n box 554\nattention: financial accounting branch\n box 554\nattention: financial accounting branch\n box 554\nattention: financial accounting branch\n box 554\nattention: financial accounting branch\n box 554\nattention: financial accounting branch\n box 554\nattention: financial accounting branch\n box 554\nattention: financial accounting branch\n box 554\nattention: financial accounting branch\n box 554\nattention: financial accounting branch\n box 554\nattention: financial accounting branch\n box 554\nattention: financial accounting branch\n box 554\nattention: financial accounting branch\n box 554\nattention: financial accounting branch\n box 554\nattention: financial accounting branch\n box 554\nattention: financial accounting branch\n bo",

    "he house of commons has passed a new law that could see asylum seekers placed under house arrest for up to four years. the law will protect asylum seekers said to have been targeted due to their political ideology.\n\"the act will be passed under the routine notification procedure without any further delay and will also protect asylum seekers said to be targeted during the course of the notification process and subsequent discovery of the asylum seekers asylum claim in the house,\" said a joint statement released by the house of commons and the ministry of justice.\nthe house of lords has passed a similar law to protect asylum seekers in the past.\n\"the draft bill contains provisions that would protect asylum seekers who were targeted by the government during the notification process and subsequently discovered to have been targeted by the government. the draft act will protect asylum seekers despite the fact that they are asylum seekers themselves and asylum seekers themselves are not political parties. all forms of political agitation or incitement to political disturbance is a serious concern when it comes to asylum seekers and asylum seekers themselves. i am convinced that this act will be executed under the routine notification procedure without any hitch as asylum seekers are political parties and hence political agitation is a serious concern to the government and its supporters.\"\n the draft law will protect asylum seekers according to the following:\n (i) asylum seekers nominated for asylum by the government\n\n(ii) asylum seekers nominated for asylum by the private security service or civilian party\n and (iii) children\n of whom asylum seekers are the main beneficiary.\n \"the draft bills make it unlawful for a family member of a refugee as the guardian of the deceased to apply to the international children's court or any tribunal to have any legal effect on the claim of this family member for whom the money was deposited\n and the proceeds have been shifted to a family member of the deceased. it is my conviction that as the guardian of the deceased and as the private security service i am the only one capable of keeping watch over the fund and this is why the draft is pending in the international children's court.\"\n the draft will also protect the family members of the deceased by making it unlawful for them to lodge any claim against the government or any tribunal with respect to this fund.\n the draft law will also protect the family members of the deceased by making it unlawful for them to lodge any claim against the government or any tribunal with respect to this fund.\n the family members will be paid for the information they disclose to the international children's court and will be given 20% of the fund for any miscommunication.\n the proceeds of this fund will be remitted to your nominated bank account where it will be held until the fund is transferred to your nominated account. i shall be contacting the attorney general of the republic of south africa to seek your cooperation and to make the claim of this fund known to the south african government. i shall also be contacting you to seek your consent to be part of the international children's court. i shall also require your full co-operation and your full co-operation in this vital issue.\n i shall require your co-operation in this respect because you are my co-operation in this regard as i am the only one capable of keeping watch over this fund and you have all the legal documents i require.

immediately to my email address and i shall send you a private message. i shall be glad to provide you with more details of this transaction.\n regards\n attorney general johannes hahn\n\nattorney

    "ntroduction of the past\n as a citizen of the republic of south africa i have a very important and lucrative business proposition for you. on the commencement of my diplomatic relations with south africa i was granted asylum in the republic of south africa by the regime of former president robert mugabe. i was not aware of any other asylum seeker on this continent that could claim this sum of $500 million dollars (us$500 million) which i had been granted. i was expecting to receive this money in the bank of a reputable investment bank in johannesburg but my present position as a finance major in south africa made this impossible for me. upon my arrival to the republic of south africa in late august of last year i lodged a formal claim with the bank with the money in the custody of one of my junior colleagues and we have been married for the past twelve months. as a result of my unsuccessful effort to claim the money as my own on my present position as a finance major in south africa and a foreigner in the bank of a reputable investment bank in johannesburg\n i am now proposing to you to take the following action to secure the funds as your own and transfer to your account as the beneficiary.\n accumulate the money into your account as a company business and once the money has been remitted to your account for investment purposes\n as soon as you receive the money into your bank account.\n i have the honour of sending you a copy of this proposal and assurance that the money will be intact and intact for investment purposes. you must have confidence that i am capable of handling this transaction under favourable arrangements. i have the honour of inviting you to come to my capital city johannesburg for a private business discussion and i shall be inviting you to come as a partner in the bank as i hope to have you be part of the successful transfer of this huge sum of money.\n the percentage will be the seventeen for beneficiary\n twenty-five percent will be for me as compensation for my labor and the remaining 10 percent will be for expenses i have incurred as a refugee. this proposal is simple and simple. i shall give you the code of ethics for this transaction as i am willing to accept the offers of sharing this money with you and that is why i am contacting you. i will give you four months to respond to me informing you of the decision to come to my bank account and the amount. i have the right to do this as i am a foreigner in south africa and i am required to take over the fund if i do not want the money declared safe in the bank by the south african government. please kindly guide and assist me in getting this fund approved as this will be my last.\n i want to raise money through a legitimate business relationship between two of my customers and the proceeds will be deposited in the bank for investment. i am also interested in building a business with you and i am banking with your firm.\n before we move\n i would like to introduce myself to you as a foreigner. i am mr. richard samson. i am the manager of financial services at client bank samson asset management ltd in london. i am the second person to come up as an interest target with the client bank but this time i was not prepared for all the situations that may arise from the fact that i am the only one in the bank with the information that could have given you the key to the million dollar deposit. i have therefore decided to \n contact you on this account to invest in your country as my country is very wealthy in the west and i am not going to let my country down by allowing my client to rob me. i am not a rich man and i am willing to give any sum as long as it is good management and good customer service. if you are interested\n please reply immediately. i will give you the contact details of the bank but i want you to be aware that as an investor here in london\n you are more than likely to invest in your country. i am not afraid to do anything to get the money as it is my country that you are about to embark on this great business venture. however\n thing is\n i am not rich and i dont live near a rich person and this is my main purpose of contacting you.i am seeking to derive a good living through my business and this is the only way i can do this through as much effort and effort as possible. i am seeking to invest in your country in a good percentage which i believe is 70% for me and 35% for you. i am proposing to you as a foreigner receive a good percentage of the total money for yourself and me.this would be negotiable by the treasury so you must provide me with the full names of the bank officials that are with whom you are seeking to invest and the actual amount involved. if you are willing to help\n i will give you 10% of the total money for you and 5% for me in the transaction. i will give you 5% of the money for every dollar yo",

    "n june 2001 the federal reserve board (the federal reserve bank of new york) issued an executive order requiring all federal reserve banks to be required to transfer all or almost all their assets to a foreign account where the money will be transferred to a holding company or other account where the funds will be remitted to.\n according to the reserve board this meant that the federal reserve government could not issue a new bank account in the united states\n they had to transfer all their existing accounts into a foreign account. this decision was made because of the instability in the south america.\n since then the money has been in a dormant account with no one knows of it.\n the central bank of nigeria prohibits the transfer of this money into foreign accounts unless the funds are frozen or used for investment purposes.\n all that is required is to want to transfer this money into a foreign account with a legitimate foreign account with a legitimate foreign account holder because this is the only viable arrangement for me and my wife.\n i have made several attempts and several unsuccessful attempts to transfer this money into a foreign account with any foreign account holder. i have decided to make a banking arrangement with a foreign account holder for the security and transfer to a foreign account where the money will be transferred to a foreign account concerned.\n i have made numerous attempts to transfer this money into a foreign account where the money will be transferred into a foreign account concerned.\n i have failed in this effort as i am not a native of nigeria and therefore cannot afford any other account in this country. i have not come across any other account that can handle this account which is also a bank account.\n i am also seeking a foreign partner in order to transfer this money into a foreign account where the funds will be paid to the bank account.\n this money is in a dormant account with no foreign account holder\n the money is in a dormant account with the south african government and this money is now in a dormant account with the south african government.\n i have a very good relationship with the south africa government\n but i have to contact you because i want to see if you can handle this money in a reliable foreign account. i have to contact you because this was a very serious financial crisis in my country. you need to know that this situation is very serious because if you can handle this money in a stable foreign account then you are in good hands.\n i have made numerous attempts and
